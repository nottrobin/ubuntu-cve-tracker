Description:
 OpenStack Compute (Nova) Grizzly, Folsom (2012.2), and Essex (2012.1)
 allows remote authenticated users to gain access to a VM in opportunistic
 circumstances by using the VNC token for a deleted VM that was bound to the
 same VNC port.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> on 11.10, VNC consoles are only available via the web interface,
  but the web interface (horizon) is not functional since it depends on
  keystone and the keystone in 11.10 is a pre-release version and unusable with
  other components like horizon and nova.
