Description:
 sudo 1.3.5 through 1.7.10p5 and 1.8.0 through 1.8.6p6, when running on
 systems without /proc or the sysctl function with the tty_tickets option
 enabled, does not properly validate the controlling terminal device, which
 allows local users with sudo permissions to hijack the authorization of
 another terminal via vectors related to connecting to a standard input,
 output, and error file descriptors of another terminal.  NOTE: this is one
 of three closely-related vulnerabilities that were originally assigned
 CVE-2013-1776, but they have been SPLIT because of different affected
 versions.
