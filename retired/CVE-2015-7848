Description:
 An integer overflow can occur in NTP-dev.4.3.70 leading to an out-of-bounds
 memory copy operation when processing a specially crafted private mode
 packet. The crafted packet needs to have the correct message authentication
 code and a valid timestamp. When processed by the NTP daemon, it leads to
 an immediate crash.
