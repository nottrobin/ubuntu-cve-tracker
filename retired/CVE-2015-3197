Description:
 ssl/s2_srvr.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1r and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2f does
 not prevent use of disabled ciphers, which makes it easier for
 man-in-the-middle attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms
 by performing computations on SSLv2 traffic, related to the
 get_client_master_key and get_client_hello functions.
