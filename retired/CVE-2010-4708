Description:
 The pam_env module in Linux-PAM (aka pam) 1.1.2 and earlier reads the
 .pam_environment file in a user's home directory, which might allow local
 users to run programs with an unintended environment by executing a program
 that relies on the pam_env PAM check.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> this changes default behaviour, after discussion with
 mdeslaur> slangasek, we should not change this in stable releases.
 mdeslaur> Patch has been reverted upstream, no consensus as of 2011-06-08
 mdeslaur> Let's ignore this for now, and change the default in the dev
 mdeslaur> release when upstream decides to change.
