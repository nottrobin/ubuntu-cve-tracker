Description:
 A CSRF issue was found in JBoss Application Server 7 before 7.1.0. JBoss
 did not properly restrict access to the management console information (for
 example via the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP access control flag).
 This can lead to unauthorized information leak if a user with admin
 privileges visits a specially-crafted web page provided by a remote
 attacker.
