Description:
 Buffer overflow in the X render (Xrender) extension in X.org X server 6.8.0
 up to allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash), as
 demonstrated by the (1) XRenderCompositeTriStrip and (2)
 XRenderCompositeTriFan requests in the rendertest from XCB xcb/xcb-demo,
 which leads to an incorrect memory allocation due to a typo in an
 expression that uses a "&" instead of a "*" operator. NOTE: the subject
 line of the original announcement used an incorrect CVE number for this
 issue.
