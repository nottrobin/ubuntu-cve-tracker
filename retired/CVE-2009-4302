Description:
 login/index_form.html in Moodle 1.8 before 1.8.11 and 1.9 before 1.9.7
 links to an index page on the HTTP port even when the page is served from
 an HTTPS port, which might cause login credentials to be sent in cleartext,
 even when SSL is intended, and allows remote attackers to obtain these
 credentials by sniffing.
