Description:
 set_file_metadata in xattr.c in GNU Wget before 1.20.1 stores a file's
 origin URL in the user.xdg.origin.url metadata attribute of the extended
 attributes of the downloaded file, which allows local users to obtain
 sensitive information (e.g., credentials contained in the URL) by reading
 this attribute, as demonstrated by getfattr. This also applies to Referer
 information in the user.xdg.referrer.url metadata attribute. According to
 2016-07-22 in the Wget ChangeLog, user.xdg.origin.url was partially based
 on the behavior of fwrite_xattr in tool_xattr.c in curl.
