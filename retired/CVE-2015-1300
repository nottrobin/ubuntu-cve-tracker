Description:
 The FrameFetchContext::updateTimingInfoForIFrameNavigation function in
 core/loader/FrameFetchContext.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
 45.0.2454.85, does not properly restrict the availability of IFRAME
 Resource Timing API times, which allows remote attackers to obtain
 sensitive information via crafted JavaScript code that leverages a
 history.back call.
