Description:
 The FilePath::ReferencesParent function in files/file_path.cc in Google
 Chrome before 29.0.1547.57 on Windows does not properly handle pathname
 components composed entirely of . (dot) and whitespace characters, which
 allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks via a
 crafted directory name.
