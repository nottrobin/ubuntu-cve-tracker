Description:
 The opj_dwt_decode_1* functions in dwt.c in OpenJPEG, as used in PDFium in
 Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73, allow remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data that is mishandled during a discrete
 wavelet transform.
