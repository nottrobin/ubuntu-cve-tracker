Description:
 A buffer overflow in OpenJPEG 2.1.1 causes arbitrary code execution when
 parsing a crafted image. An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists
 in the jpeg2000 image file format parser as implemented in the OpenJpeg
 library. A specially crafted jpeg2000 file can cause an out of bound heap
 write resulting in heap corruption leading to arbitrary code execution. For
 a successful attack, the target user needs to open a malicious jpeg2000
 file. The jpeg2000 image file format is mostly used for embedding images
 inside PDF documents and the OpenJpeg library is used by a number of
 popular PDF renderers making PDF documents a likely attack vector.
