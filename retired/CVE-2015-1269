Description:
 The DecodeHSTSPreloadRaw function in net/http/transport_security_state.cc
 in Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.130 does not properly canonicalize DNS
 hostnames before making comparisons to HSTS or HPKP preload entries, which
 allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a string
 that (1) ends in a . (dot) character or (2) is not entirely lowercase.
