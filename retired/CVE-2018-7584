Description:
 In PHP through 5.6.33, 7.0.x before 7.0.28, 7.1.x through 7.1.14, and 7.2.x
 through 7.2.2, there is a stack-based buffer under-read while parsing an
 HTTP response in the php_stream_url_wrap_http_ex function in
 ext/standard/http_fopen_wrapper.c. This subsequently results in copying a
 large string.
