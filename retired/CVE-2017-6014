Description:
 In Wireshark 2.2.4 and earlier, a crafted or malformed STANAG 4607 capture
 file will cause an infinite loop and memory exhaustion. If the packet size
 field in a packet header is null, the offset to read from will not advance,
 causing continuous attempts to read the same zero length packet. This will
 quickly exhaust all system memory.
