Description:
 The JSSubScriptLoader in Mozilla Firefox 4.x through 6 and SeaMonkey before
 2.4 does not properly handle XPCNativeWrappers during calls to the
 loadSubScript method in an add-on, which makes it easier for remote
 attackers to gain privileges via a crafted web site that leverages certain
 unwrapping behavior.
