Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE
 (subcomponent: Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java
 SE: 7u121 and 8u112; Java SE Embedded: 8u111. Easily exploitable
 vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via
 multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful
 attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker.
 Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access
 to critical data or complete access to all Java SE, Java SE Embedded
 accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
 typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or
 sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that
 comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
 vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers,
 that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an
 administrator). CVSS v3.0 Base Score 6.5 (Confidentiality impacts).
