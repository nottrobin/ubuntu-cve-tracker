Description:
 An issue was discovered in the cantata-mounter D-Bus service in Cantata
 through 2.3.1. The wrapper script 'mount.cifs.wrapper' uses the shell to
 forward the arguments to the actual mount.cifs binary. The shell evaluates
 wildcards (such as in an injected string:/home/../tmp/* string).
