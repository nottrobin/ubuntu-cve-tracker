Description:
 The ext3 code in Linux 2.4.x before 2.4.26 does not properly initialize
 journal descriptor blocks, which causes an information leak in which
 in-memory data is written to the device for the ext3 file system, which
 allows privileged users to obtain portions of kernel memory by reading the
 raw device.
