Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** OpenSSL before 0.9.8l, and 0.9.8m through 1.x, does not
 properly restrict client-initiated renegotiation within the SSL and TLS
 protocols, which might make it easier for remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (CPU consumption) by performing many renegotiations
 within a single connection, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-5094.
 NOTE: it can also be argued that it is the responsibility of server
 deployments, not a security library, to prevent or limit renegotiation when
 it is inappropriate within a specific environment.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Protocol issue. Nothing to be done at this time. Marking low
  because while renegotiation makes the DoS faster, standard DoS methods
  still apply for SSL servers that need to setup the SSL connection.
 jdstrand> per Redhat, should not affect httpd/mod_ssl
 mdeslaur> this CVE is specific to openssl, nss is in CVE-2011-5094
 mdeslaur> we're not going to fix this, since it's disputed
