Description:
 Puppet 2.6.x before 2.6.15 and 2.7.x before 2.7.13, and Puppet Enterprise
 (PE) Users 1.0, 1.1, 1.2.x, 2.0.x, and 2.5.x before 2.5.1 allows remote
 authenticated users with agent SSL keys and file-creation permissions on
 the puppet master to execute arbitrary commands by creating a file whose
 full pathname contains shell metacharacters, then performing a filebucket
 request. telnet.rb in Puppet 2.7.x before 2.7.13 and Puppet Enterprise (PE)
 1.2.x, 2.0.x, and 2.5.x before 2.5.1 allows local users to overwrite
 arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the NET::Telnet connection log
 (/tmp/out.log).
