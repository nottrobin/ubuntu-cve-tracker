Description:
 main/acl.c in Asterisk Open Source 1.6.0.x before 1.6.0.25, 1.6.1.x before
 1.6.1.17, and 1.6.2.x before 1.6.2.5 does not properly enforce remote host
 access controls when CIDR notation "/0" is used in permit= and deny=
 configuration rules, which causes an improper arithmetic shift and might
 allow remote attackers to bypass ACL rules and access services from
 unauthorized hosts.
