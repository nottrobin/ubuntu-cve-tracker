Description:
 The International Domain Name (IDN) support in Konqueror 3.2.1 on KDE 3.2.1
 allows remote attackers to spoof domain names using punycode encoded domain
 names that are decoded in URLs and SSL certificates in a way that uses
 homograph characters from other character sets, which facilitates phishing
 attacks.
