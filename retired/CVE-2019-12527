Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid 4.0.23 through 4.7. When checking Basic
 Authentication with HttpHeader::getAuth, Squid uses a global buffer to
 store the decoded data. Squid does not check that the decoded length isn't
 greater than the buffer, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow with user
 controlled data.
