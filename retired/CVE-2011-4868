Description:
 The logging functionality in dhcpd in ISC DHCP before 4.2.3-P2, when using
 Dynamic DNS (DDNS) and issuing IPv6 addresses, does not properly handle the
 DHCPv6 lease structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via crafted packets
 related to a lease-status update.
