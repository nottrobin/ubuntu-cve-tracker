Description:
 The dissect_ber_constrained_bitstring function in
 epan/dissectors/packet-ber.c in the ASN.1 BER dissector in Wireshark 2.0.x
 before 2.0.2 does not verify that a certain length is nonzero, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and
 application crash) via a crafted packet.
