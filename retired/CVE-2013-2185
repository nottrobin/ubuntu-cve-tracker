Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The readObject method in the DiskFileItem class in Apache
 Tomcat and JBoss Web, as used in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application
 Platform 6.1.0 and Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.0.0, allows remote attackers to
 write to arbitrary files via a NULL byte in a file name in a serialized
 instance, a similar issue to CVE-2013-2186.  NOTE: this issue is reportedly
 disputed by the Apache Tomcat team, although Red Hat considers it a
 vulnerability. The dispute appears to regard whether it is the
 responsibility of applications to avoid providing untrusted data to be
 deserialized, or whether this class should inherently protect against this
 issue.
