Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit component of Oracle
 Java SE (subcomponent: JSSE). Supported versions that are affected are Java
 SE: 6u201, 7u191, 8u182 and 11; Java SE Embedded: 8u181; JRockit: R28.3.19.
 Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
 network access via SSL/TLS to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded,
 JRockit. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
 unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE, Java SE
 Embedded, JRockit accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a
 subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit accessible data and
 unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of
 Java SE, Java SE Embedded, JRockit. Note: This vulnerability applies to
 Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start
 applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run
 untrusted code (e.g. code that comes from the internet) and rely on the
 Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by
 using APIs in the specified Component, e.g. through a web service which
 supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.6 (Confidentiality,
 Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).
Ubuntu-Description:
 Felix Dörre discovered that the Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE)
 implementation in OpenJDK did not ensure that the same endpoint
 identification algorithm was used during TLS session resumption as
 during initial session setup. An attacker could use this to expose
 sensitive information.
