Description:
 Integer overflow in the SkAutoSTArray implementation in
 include/core/SkTemplates.h in the filters implementation in Skia, as used
 in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors
 that trigger a reset action with a large count value, leading to an
 out-of-bounds write operation.
