Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the read function in
 filters/words/msword-odf/wv2/src/styles.cpp in the Microsoft import filter
 in Calligra 2.4.3 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
 crafted ODF style in an ODF document.  NOTE: this is the same vulnerability
 as CVE-2012-3455, but it was SPLIT by the CNA even though Calligra and
 KOffice share the same codebase.
