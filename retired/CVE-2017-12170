Description:
 Downstream version 1.0.46-1 of pure-ftpd as shipped in Fedora was
 vulnerable to packaging error due to which the original configuration was
 ignored after update and service started running with default
 configuration. This has security implications because of overriding
 security-related configuration. This issue doesn't affect upstream version
 of pure-ftpd.
