Description:
 The PTR_MANGLE implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6)
 2.4, 2.17, and earlier, and Embedded GLIBC (EGLIBC) does not initialize the
 random value for the pointer guard, which makes it easier for
 context-dependent attackers to control execution flow by leveraging a
 buffer-overflow vulnerability in an application and using the known zero
 value pointer guard to calculate a pointer address.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> PoC in linux-distros@ (tested on Ubuntu 12.04, 13.04 and Debian 7.1)
 jdstrand> Only statically compiled executables, dynamic not affected
 jdstrand> upstream patch not available as of 2013-07-12
 sarnold> PTR MANGLE is a security-hardening feature; exploiting this flaw
  requires a flaw in a statically linked executable that allows write
  access to one of the types of pointers that is mangled. Fixing the
  consequences of this flaw requires rebuilding all security-sensitive
  statically linked executables.
 mdeslaur> fix for this was reverted in saucy as it was causing the ARM
 mdeslaur> testuite to fail.
 sbeattie> fix was re-enabled in trusty with the addition of the
  patches/any/cvs-CVE-2013-4788-static-ptrguard-arm.diff patch.
 mdeslaur> we will not be fixing this issue for earlier releases.
