Description:
 The ap_pregsub function in server/util.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x
 through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the mod_setenvif module is
 enabled, does not restrict the size of values of environment variables,
 which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption
 or NULL pointer dereference) via a .htaccess file with a crafted SetEnvIf
 directive, in conjunction with a crafted HTTP request header, related to
 (1) the "len +=" statement and (2) the apr_pcalloc function call, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2011-3607.
