Description:
 PulseAudio 0.9.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (daemon crash) via (1) a PA_PSTREAM_DESCRIPTOR_LENGTH value of
 FRAME_SIZE_MAX_ALLOW sent on TCP port 9875, which triggers a p->export
 assertion failure in do_read; (2) a PA_PSTREAM_DESCRIPTOR_LENGTH value of 0
 sent on TCP port 9875, which triggers a length assertion failure in
 pa_memblock_new; or (3) an empty packet on UDP port 9875, which triggers a
 t assertion failure in pa_sdp_parse; and allows remote authenticated users
 to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted packet on TCP
 port 9875 that (4) triggers a maxlength assertion failure in
 pa_memblockq_new, (5) triggers a size assertion failure in pa_xmalloc, or
 (6) plays a certain sound file.
