Description:
 Integer overflow in the str_replace function in PHP 4 before 4.4.5 and PHP
 5 before 5.2.1 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code
 via a single character search string in conjunction with a long replacement
 string, which overflows a 32 bit length counter.  NOTE: this is probably
 the same issue as CVE-2007-0906.6.
