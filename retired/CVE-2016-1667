Description:
 The TreeScope::adoptIfNeeded function in
 WebKit/Source/core/dom/TreeScope.cpp in the DOM implementation in Blink, as
 used in Google Chrome before 50.0.2661.102, does not prevent script
 execution during node-adoption operations, which allows remote attackers to
 bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted web site.
