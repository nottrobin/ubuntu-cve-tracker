Description:
 MySQL 5.0.88, and possibly other versions and platforms, allows local users
 to bypass certain privilege checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM
 table with modified (1) DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments
 that are originally associated with pathnames without symlinks, and that
 can point to tables created at a future time at which a pathname is
 modified to contain a symlink to a subdirectory of the MySQL data home
 directory, related to incorrect calculation of the
 mysql_unpacked_real_data_home value.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
 because of a CVE-2009-4030 regression, which was not omitted in other
 packages and versions such as MySQL 5.0.95 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> As of 2012/01/09, Oracle no longer supports MySQL 5.0.
  Unfortunately, because of upstream update and commit policies it is not
  possible to backport patches from later releases. Ubuntu is regrettably
  unable to support MySQL 5.0 and users are encouraged to upgrade to Ubuntu
  10.04 LTS or later.
