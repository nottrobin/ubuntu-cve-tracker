Description:
 lib/puppet/ssl/certificate_authority.rb in Puppet before 2.6.17 and 2.7.x
 before 2.7.18, and Puppet Enterprise before 2.5.2, does not properly
 restrict the characters in the Common Name field of a Certificate Signing
 Request (CSR), which makes it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to
 trick administrators into signing a crafted agent certificate via ANSI
 control sequences.
