 Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) 1.0.0 through 1.3.2 and 2.0.0 through
 2.0.3, when AttachmentDownloadType is set to inline, renders text/html
 e-mail attachments as HTML in the browser when the queue moderator attempts

 arbitrary web script or HTML.  NOTE: this particular issue is referred to
 as XSS by some sources.
