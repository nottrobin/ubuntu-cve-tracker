Description:
 Samba from version 4.7.0 has a vulnerability that allows a user in a Samba
 AD domain to crash the KDC when Samba is built in the non-default MIT
 Kerberos configuration. With this advisory the Samba Team clarify that the
 MIT Kerberos build of the Samba AD DC is considered experimental. Therefore
 the Samba Team will not issue security patches for this configuration.
 Additionally, Samba 4.7.12, 4.8.7 and 4.9.3 have been issued as security
 releases to prevent building of the AD DC with MIT Kerberos unless
 --with-experimental-mit-ad-dc is specified to the configure command.
