Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the svcauth_gss_validate function in
 lib/rpc/svc_auth_gss.c in the RPCSEC_GSS RPC library (librpcsecgss) in MIT
 Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.4 through 1.6.2, as used by the Kerberos administration
 daemon (kadmind) and some third-party applications that use krb5, allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and probably
 execute arbitrary code via a long string in an RPC message.
