Description:
 Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.241 and 14.x before 14.0.0.176 on Windows
 and OS X and before 11.2.202.400 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 14.0.0.178 on
 Windows and OS X and before 14.0.0.179 on Android, Adobe AIR SDK before
 14.0.0.178, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 14.0.0.178 do not properly
 restrict the SWF file format, which allows remote attackers to conduct
 cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against JSONP endpoints, and
 obtain sensitive information, via a crafted OBJECT element with SWF content
 satisfying the character-set requirements of a callback API, in conjunction
 with a manipulation involving a '$' (dollar sign) or '(' (open parenthesis)
 character. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2014-4671.
