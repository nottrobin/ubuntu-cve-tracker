Description:
 Buffer overflow in the environment variable substitution code in main.c in
 OSH 1.7-14 allows local users to inject arbitrary environment variables,
 such as LD_PRELOAD, via pathname arguments of the form "$VAR/EVAR=arg",
 which cause the EVAR portion to be appended to a buffer returned by a
 getenv function call.
