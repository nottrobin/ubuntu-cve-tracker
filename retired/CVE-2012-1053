Description:
 The change_user method in the SUIDManager (lib/puppet/util/suidmanager.rb)
 in Puppet 2.6.x before 2.6.14 and 2.7.x before 2.7.11, and Puppet
 Enterprise (PE) Users 1.0, 1.1, 1.2.x, 2.0.x before 2.0.3 does not properly
 manage group privileges, which allows local users to gain privileges via
 vectors related to (1) the change_user not dropping supplementary groups in
 certain conditions, (2) changes to the eguid without associated changes to
 the egid, or (3) the addition of the real gid to supplementary groups.
