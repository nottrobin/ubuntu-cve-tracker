Description:
 The KRandom::random function in KDE Paste Applet after 4.10.5 in
 kdeplasma-addons uses the GNU C Library rand function's linear congruential
 generator, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to defeat
 cryptographic protection mechanisms by predicting the generator output.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> This CVE is for an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-2120, which
  means that it only really applies to packages where the upstream fix
  for CVE-2013-2120 was used. I believe that is only raring-proposed as
  of 2013-06-26, but I'm marking this needed for all releases, to ensure
  the incorrect fix is not used alone.
