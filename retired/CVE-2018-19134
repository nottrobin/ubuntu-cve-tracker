Description:
 In Artifex Ghostscript through 9.25, the setpattern operator did not
 properly validate certain types. A specially crafted PostScript document
 could exploit this to crash Ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary
 code in the context of the Ghostscript process. This is a type confusion
 issue because of failure to check whether the Implementation of a pattern
 dictionary was a structure type.
