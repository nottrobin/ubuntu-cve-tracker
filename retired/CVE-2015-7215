Description:
 The importScripts function in the Web Workers API implementation in Mozilla
 Firefox before 43.0 allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin
 Policy by triggering use of the no-cors mode in the fetch API to attempt
 resource access that throws an exception, leading to information disclosure
 after a rethrow.
