Description:
 Google Chrome before 4.0.249.89, when a SOCKS 5 proxy server is configured,
 sends DNS queries directly, which allows remote DNS servers to obtain
 potentially sensitive information about the identity of a client user via
 request logging, as demonstrated by a proxy server that was configured for
 the purpose of anonymity.
