Description:
 An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin 4.8.x before 4.8.2, in which an
 attacker can include (view and potentially execute) files on the server.
 The vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected
 and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test for whitelisted pages.
 An attacker must be authenticated, except in the
 "$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true" case (where an attacker can specify
 any host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on
 phpMyAdmin) and the "$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0" case (which bypasses the
 login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication).
