Description:
 Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the get_header function in
 header.c for LHA 1.14, as used in products such as Barracuda Spam Firewall,
 allow remote attackers or local users to execute arbitrary code via long
 directory or file names in an LHA archive, which triggers the overflow when
 testing or extracting the archive.
