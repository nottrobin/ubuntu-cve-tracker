Description:
 An exploitable memory corruption vulnerability exists in the Websocket
 protocol implementation of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. A specially crafted
 websocket packet can cause a buffer to be allocated while leaving stale
 pointers which leads to a use-after-free vulnerability which can be
 exploited to achieve remote code execution. An attacker needs to send a
 specially crafted websocket packet over the network to trigger this
 vulnerability.
