Description:
 Use-after-free vulnerability in core/dom/ContainerNode.cpp in Blink, as
 used in Google Chrome before 31.0.1650.48, allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging
 improper handling of DOM range objects in circumstances that require child
 node removal after a (1) mutation or (2) blur event.
