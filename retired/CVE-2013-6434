Description:
 The remote-viewer in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager (RHEV-M)
 before 3.3, when using a native SPICE client invocation method, initially
 makes insecure connections to the SPICE server, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof the SPICE server.

Notes:
 sarnold> Insufficient details were provided to determine where the fault
  is -- the Red Hat update is to their rhevm package -- so I've marked spice
  as the involved package until this can be researched further.
