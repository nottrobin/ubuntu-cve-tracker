Description:
 A vulnerability in the Object Linking & Embedding (OLE2) file scanning
 functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and
 prior could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
 service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack
 of proper input and validation checking mechanisms for OLE2 files sent an
 affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
 malformed OLE2 files to the device running an affected version ClamAV
 Software. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an out-of-bounds
 write condition, resulting in a crash that could result in a denial of
 service condition on an affected device.
