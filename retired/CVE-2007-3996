Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in libgd in PHP before 5.2.4 allow remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly
 execute arbitrary code via a large (1) srcW or (2) srcH value to the (a)
 gdImageCopyResized function, or a large (3) sy (height) or (4) sx (width)
 value to the (b) gdImageCreate or the (c) gdImageCreateTrueColor function.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> note this is gdImageCreate and gdImageCreateTrueColor
 jdstrand> dapper-gutsy libgd2 are affected to varying degrees
 jdstrand> php5-gd segfaults on feisty and gutsy before patching libgd2,
   and dapper-gutsy segfault after (this is because feisty-gutsy had a partial
   fix already in libgd2).  php5-gd is not handling the error condition when
   libgd2 fails properly.  Verified that 5.2.4 works with patched libgd2.
