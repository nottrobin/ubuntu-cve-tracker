Description:
 Use-after-free vulnerability in the V8 bindings in Blink, as used in Google
 Chrome before 37.0.2062.94, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging improper
 use of HashMap add operations instead of HashMap set operations, related to
 bindings/core/v8/DOMWrapperMap.h and
 bindings/core/v8/SerializedScriptValue.cpp.
