Description:
 The V8ThrowException::createDOMException function in
 bindings/core/v8/V8ThrowException.cpp in the V8 bindings in Blink, as used
 in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.111 on Windows, OS X, and Linux and
 before 40.0.2214.109 on Android, does not properly consider frame access
 restrictions during the throwing of an exception, which allows remote
 attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted web site.
