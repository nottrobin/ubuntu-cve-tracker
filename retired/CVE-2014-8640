Description:
 The mozilla::dom::AudioParamTimeline::AudioNodeInputValue function in the
 Web Audio API implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 35.0 and SeaMonkey
 before 2.32 does not properly restrict timeline operations, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized-memory read
 and application crash) via crafted API calls.
