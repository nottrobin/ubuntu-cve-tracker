Description:
 click/install.py in click does not require files in package filesystem
 tarballs to start with ./ (dot slash), which allows remote attackers to
 install an alternate security policy and gain privileges via a crafted
 package, as demonstrated by the test.mmrow app for Ubuntu phone.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> app can ship a crafted .click directory that can be used to trick
  click into installing unintended security policy
 jdstrand> snappy not affected per me and mvo
 jdstrand> patch from cjwatson, but not committed to bzr yet
 jdstrand> updates also needed for vivid stable-phone-overlay and wily
  stable-phone-overlay.
