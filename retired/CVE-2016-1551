Description:
 ntpd in NTP 4.2.8p3 and NTPsec a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92
 relies on the underlying operating system to protect it from requests that
 impersonate reference clocks. Because reference clocks are treated like
 other peers and stored in the same structure, any packet with a source ip
 address of a reference clock (127.127.1.1 for example) that reaches the
 receive() function will match that reference clock's peer record and will
 be treated as a trusted peer. Any system that lacks the typical martian
 packet filtering which would block these packets is in danger of having its
 time controlled by an attacker.
