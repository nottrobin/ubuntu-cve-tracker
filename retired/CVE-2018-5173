Description:
 The filename appearing in the "Downloads" panel improperly renders some
 Unicode characters, allowing for the file name to be spoofed. This can be
 used to obscure the file extension of potentially executable files from
 user view in the panel. Note: the dialog to open the file will show the
 full, correct filename and whether it is executable or not. This
 vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
