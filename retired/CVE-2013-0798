Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 20.0 on Android uses world-writable and
 world-readable permissions for the app_tmp installation directory in the
 local filesystem, which allows attackers to modify add-ons before
 installation via an application that leverages the time window during which
 app_tmp is used.
