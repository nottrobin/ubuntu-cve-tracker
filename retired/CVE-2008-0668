Description:
 The excel_read_HLINK function in plugins/excel/ms-excel-read.c in Gnome
 Office Gnumeric before 1.8.1 allows user-assisted remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted XLS file containing XLS HLINK opcodes,
 possibly because of an integer signedness error that leads to an integer
 overflow.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
 information.
