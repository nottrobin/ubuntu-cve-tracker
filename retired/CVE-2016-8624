Description:
 curl before version 7.51.0 doesn't parse the authority component of the URL
 correctly when the host name part ends with a '#' character, and could
 instead be tricked into connecting to a different host. This may have
 security implications if you for example use an URL parser that follows the
 RFC to check for allowed domains before using curl to request them.
