Description:
 Google V8, as used in Google Chrome before 38.0.2125.101, does not properly
 track JavaScript heap-memory allocations as allocations of uninitialized
 memory and does not properly concatenate arrays of double-precision
 floating-point numbers, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information via crafted JavaScript code, related to the
 PagedSpace::AllocateRaw and NewSpace::AllocateRaw functions in
 heap/spaces-inl.h, the LargeObjectSpace::AllocateRaw function in
 heap/spaces.cc, and the Runtime_ArrayConcat function in runtime.cc.
