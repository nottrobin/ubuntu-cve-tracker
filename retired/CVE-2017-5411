Description:
 A use-after-free can occur during buffer storage operations within the
 ANGLE graphics library, used for WebGL content. The buffer storage can be
 freed while still in use in some circumstances, leading to a potentially
 exploitable crash. Note: This issue is in "libGLES", which is only in use
 on Windows. Other operating systems are not affected. This vulnerability
 affects Firefox < 52 and Thunderbird < 52.
