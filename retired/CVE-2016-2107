Description:
 The AES-NI implementation in OpenSSL before 1.0.1t and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2h
 does not consider memory allocation during a certain padding check, which
 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive cleartext information via a
 padding-oracle attack against an AES CBC session. NOTE: this vulnerability
 exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2013-0169.
