Description: 
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Marc Schoenefeld discovered that OpenOffice.org would run document macros
 from the macro browser, even when macros were disabled.  If a user were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted document and examining a macro,
 a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges.
