Description:
 Buffer overflow in the MSN protocol handler for gaim 0.79 to 1.0.1 allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via an "unexpected sequence of MSNSLP
 messages" that results in an unbounded copy operation that writes to the
 wrong buffer.
