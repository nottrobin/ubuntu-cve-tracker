Description:
 The dissector_postgresql function in dissectors/ec_postgresql.c in Ettercap
 before 0.8.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted password length, which
 triggers a 0 character to be written to an arbitrary memory location.
