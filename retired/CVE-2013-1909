Description:
 The Python client in Apache Qpid before 2.2 does not verify that the server
 hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
 subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid
 certificate.
