Description:
 mod_proxy in httpd in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.9, when running on Unix, does
 not close the backend connection if a timeout occurs when reading a
 response from a persistent connection, which allows remote attackers to
 obtain a potentially sensitive response intended for a different client in
 opportunistic circumstances via a normal HTTP request.  NOTE: this is the
 same issue as CVE-2010-2068, but for a different OS and set of affected
 versions.
