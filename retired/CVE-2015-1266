Description:
 content/browser/webui/content_web_ui_controller_factory.cc in Google Chrome
 before 43.0.2357.130 does not properly consider the scheme in determining
 whether a URL is associated with a WebUI SiteInstance, which allows remote
 attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a similar URL, as
 demonstrated by use of http://gpu when there is a WebUI class for handling
 chrome://gpu requests.
