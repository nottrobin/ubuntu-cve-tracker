 The JavaScript implementation in Google Chrome 4 does not properly restrict
 the set of values contained in the object returned by the getComputedStyle
 method, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information about
 visited web pages by calling this method. NOTE: this may overlap
 CVE-2010-5070.
