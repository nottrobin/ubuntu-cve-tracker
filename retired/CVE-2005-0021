Candidate: CVE-2005-0021

Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in Exim before 4.43 may allow attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via (1) an IPv6 address with more than 8 components,
 as demonstrated using the -be command line option, which triggers an
 overflow in the host_aton function, or (2) the -bh command line option or
 dnsdb PTR lookup, which triggers an overflow in the dns_build_reverse
 function.
