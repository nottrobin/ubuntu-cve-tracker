Description:
 Integer overflow in PuTTY 0.62 and earlier, WinSCP before 5.1.6, and other
 products that use PuTTY allows remote SSH servers to cause a denial of
 service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code in certain applications
 that use PuTTY via a negative size value in an RSA key signature during the
 SSH handshake, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
