Description:
 Race condition in fileserver in OpenAFS 1.3.50 through 1.4.5 and 1.5.0
 through 1.5.27 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon
 crash) by simultaneously acquiring and giving back file callbacks, which
 causes the handler for the GiveUpAllCallBacks RPC to perform linked-list
 operations without the host_glock lock.
