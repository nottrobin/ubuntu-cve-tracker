Description:
 cfg80211 in net/wireless/scan.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.30-rc1 and other
 versions before 2.6.31-rc6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (crash) via a sequence of beacon frames in which one frame omits an
 SSID Information Element (IE) and the subsequent frame contains an SSID IE,
 which triggers a NULL pointer dereference in the cmp_ies function.  NOTE: a
 potential weakness in the is_mesh function was also addressed, but the
 relevant condition did not exist in the code, so it is not a vulnerability.
