Description:
 The HTTP BIO connector in Apache Tomcat 7.0.x before 7.0.12 does not
 properly handle HTTP pipelining, which allows remote attackers to read
 responses intended for other clients in opportunistic circumstances by
 examining the application data in HTTP packets, related to "a mix-up of
 responses for requests from different users."
