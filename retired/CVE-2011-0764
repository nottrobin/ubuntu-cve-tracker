Description:
 t1lib 5.1.2 and earlier, as used in Xpdf before 3.02pl6, teTeX, and other
 products, uses an invalid pointer in conjunction with a dereference
 operation, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
 crafted Type 1 font in a PDF document, as demonstrated by
 testz.2184122398.pdf.
