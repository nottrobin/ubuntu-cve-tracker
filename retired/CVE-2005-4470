Candidate: CVE-2005-4470
References:
 http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-238-2
Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the get_bhead function in readfile.c in
 Blender BlenLoader 2.0 through 2.40pre allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
 via a .blend file with a negative bhead.len value, which causes less memory
 to be allocated than expected, possibly due to an integer overflow.
