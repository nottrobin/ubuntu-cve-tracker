Description:
 The default configuration for the file upload handling system in Django
 before 1.4.14, 1.5.x before 1.5.9, 1.6.x before 1.6.6, and 1.7 before
 release candidate 3 uses a sequential file name generation process when a
 file with a conflicting name is uploaded, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by unloading a multiple files
 with the same name.
