Description:
 A certain Debian patch for OpenSSH before 4.3p2-9etch3 on etch, and before
 4.6p1-1 on sid and lenny, uses functions that are not async-signal-safe in
 the signal handler for login timeouts, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (connection slot exhaustion) via multiple login
 attempts.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect fix for
 CVE-2006-5051.
