Description:
 The navigator.sendBeacon implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 37.0,
 Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.6, and Thunderbird before 31.6 processes HTTP
 30x status codes for redirects after a preflight request has occurred,
 which allows remote attackers to bypass intended CORS access-control checks
 and conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks via a crafted web
 site, a similar issue to CVE-2014-8638.
