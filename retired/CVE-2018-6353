Description:
 The Python console in Electrum through 2.9.4 and 3.x through 3.0.5 supports
 arbitrary Python code without considering (1) social-engineering attacks in
 which a user pastes code that they do not understand and (2) code pasted by
 a physically proximate attacker at an unattended workstation, which makes
 it easier for attackers to steal Bitcoin via hook code that runs at a later
 time when the wallet password has been entered, a different vulnerability
 than CVE-2018-1000022.
