Description:
 TCP, when using a large Window Size, makes it easier for remote attackers
 to guess sequence numbers and cause a denial of service (connection loss)
 to persistent TCP connections by repeatedly injecting a TCP RST packet,
 especially in protocols that use long-lived connections, such as BGP.

Notes:
 kees> this does not really affect the Linux TCP stack in any meaningful way.
