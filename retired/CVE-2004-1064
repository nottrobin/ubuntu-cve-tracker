Description:
 The safe mode checks in PHP 4.x to 4.3.9 and PHP 5.x to 5.0.2 truncate the
 file path before passing the data to the realpath function, which could
 allow attackers to bypass safe mode.  NOTE: this issue was originally
 REJECTed by its CNA before publication, but that decision is in active
 dispute.  This candidate may change significantly in the future as a result
 of further discussion.
