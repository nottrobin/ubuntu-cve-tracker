Description:
 An information leak exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol in Pidgin.
 Specially crafted MXIT data sent to the server could potentially result in
 an out-of-bounds read. A user could be convinced to enter a particular
 string which would then get converted incorrectly and could lead to a
 potential out-of-bounds read.
