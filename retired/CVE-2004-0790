Description:
 Multiple TCP/IP and ICMP implementations allow remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (reset TCP connections) via spoofed ICMP error messages,
 aka the "blind connection-reset attack."  NOTE: CVE-2004-0790,
 CVE-2004-0791, and CVE-2004-1060 have been SPLIT based on different
 attacks; CVE-2005-0065, CVE-2005-0066, CVE-2005-0067, and CVE-2005-0068 are
 related identifiers that are SPLIT based on the underlying vulnerability.
 While CVE normally SPLITs based on vulnerability, the attack-based
 identifiers exist due to the variety and number of affected implementations
 and solutions that address the attacks instead of the underlying
 vulnerabilities.
