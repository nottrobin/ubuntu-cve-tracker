Description:
 An issue was discovered in WavPack 5.1.0 and earlier for DSDiff input.
 Out-of-bounds writes can occur because ParseDsdiffHeaderConfig in dsdiff.c
 does not validate the sizes of unknown chunks before attempting memory
 allocation, related to a lack of integer-overflow protection within a
 bytes_to_copy calculation and subsequent malloc call, leading to
 insufficient memory allocation.
