Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in Jinja2 2.10. The from_string
 function is prone to Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) where it takes
 the "source" parameter as a template object, renders it, and then returns
 it. The attacker can exploit it with {{INJECTION COMMANDS}} in a URI. NOTE:
 The maintainer and multiple third parties believe that this vulnerability
 isn't valid because users shouldn't use untrusted templates without
 sandboxing.
