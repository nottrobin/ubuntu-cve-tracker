Description:
 procps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow in
 pgrep. This vulnerability is mitigated by FORTIFY, as it involves strncat()
 to a stack-allocated string. When pgrep is compiled with FORTIFY (as on Red
 Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora), the impact is limited to a crash.
