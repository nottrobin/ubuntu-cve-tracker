Description:
 Integer overflow in the _zip_cdir_new function in zip_dirent.c in libzip
 0.11.2 and earlier, as used in the ZIP extension in PHP before 5.4.39,
 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 and other products, allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a ZIP archive that contains many
 entries, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

 mdeslaur> libzip in trusty and earlier doesn't support ZIP64, so doesn't
 mdeslaur> look vulnerable.
 mdeslaur> php5 in utopic and earlier doesn't support ZIP64 either.
