Description:
 The mm_newkeys_from_blob function in monitor_wrap.c in sshd in OpenSSH 6.2
 and 6.3, when an AES-GCM cipher is used, does not properly initialize
 memory for a MAC context data structure, which allows remote authenticated
 users to bypass intended ForceCommand and login-shell restrictions via
 packet data that provides a crafted callback address.
