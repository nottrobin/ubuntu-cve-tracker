Description:
 The dataconn function in ftpd.c in netkit ftpd (netkit-ftpd) 0.17, when
 certain modifications to support SSL have been introduced, calls fclose on
 an uninitialized file stream, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly have unspecified other impact
 via some types of FTP over SSL protocol behavior, as demonstrated by
 breaking a passive FTP DATA connection in a way that triggers an error in
 the server's SSL_accept function. NOTE: the netkit ftp issue is covered by
 CVE-2007-5769.
