Description:
 phpBB 2.0.17 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass protection
 mechanisms that deregister global variables by setting both a
 GET/POST/COOKIE (GPC) variable and a GLOBALS[] variable with the same name,
 which causes phpBB to unset the GLOBALS[] variable but not the GPC
 variable.
