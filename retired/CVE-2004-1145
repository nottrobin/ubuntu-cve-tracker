Description:
 Multiple vulnerabilities in Konqueror in KDE 3.3.1 and earlier (1) allow
 access to restricted Java classes via JavaScript and (2) do not properly
 restrict access to certain Java classes from the Java applet, which allows
 remote attackers to bypass sandbox restrictions and read or write arbitrary
 files.
