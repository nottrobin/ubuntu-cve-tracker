Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE
 (subcomponent: RMI). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE:
 6u181, 7u171 and 8u162; JRockit: R28.3.17. Difficult to exploit
 vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via
 multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, JRockit. Successful attacks
 require human interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful
 attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or
 delete access to some of Java SE, JRockit accessible data as well as
 unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, JRockit accessible data.
 Note: This vulnerability can only be exploited by supplying data to APIs in
 the specified Component without using Untrusted Java Web Start applications
 or Untrusted Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base
 Score 4.2 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N).
Ubuntu-Description:
 Moritz Bechler discovered that the RMI component of OpenJDK enabled
 HTTP transport for RMI servers by default. A remote attacker could use
 this to gain access to restricted services.
Notes:
 sbeattie> Oracle note on this issue:
   Server side HTTP-tunneled RMI connections have been disabled
   by default in this release. This behavior can be reverted by
   setting the runtime property sun.rmi.server.disableIncomingHttp
   property to false.  Note, this should not be confused with the
   sun.rmi.server.disableHttp property, which disables HTTP-tunneling
   on the client side and is false by default.
