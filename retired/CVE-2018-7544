Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** A cross-protocol scripting issue was discovered in the
 management interface in OpenVPN through 2.4.5. When this interface is
 enabled over TCP without a password, and when no other clients are
 connected to this interface, attackers can execute arbitrary management
 commands, obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial of service
 (SIGTERM) by triggering XMLHttpRequest actions in a web browser. This is
 demonstrated by a multipart/form-data POST to http://localhost:23000 with a
 "signal SIGTERM" command in a TEXTAREA element. NOTE: The vendor disputes
 that this is a vulnerability. They state that this is the result of
 improper configuration of the OpenVPN instance rather than an intrinsic
 vulnerability, and now more explicitly warn against such configurations in
 both the management-interface documentation, and with a runtime warning.
