Description:
 Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 49 and Firefox ESR 45.4. Some
 of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with
 enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
 This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 45.5, Firefox ESR < 45.5, and
 Firefox < 50.
