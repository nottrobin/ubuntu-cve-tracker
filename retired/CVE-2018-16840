Description:
 A heap use-after-free flaw was found in curl versions from 7.59.0 through
 7.61.1 in the code related to closing an easy handle. When closing and
 cleaning up an 'easy' handle in the `Curl_close()` function, the library
 code first frees a struct (without nulling the pointer) and might then
 subsequently erroneously write to a struct field within that already freed
 struct.
