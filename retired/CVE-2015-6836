Description:
 The SoapClient __call method in ext/soap/soap.c in PHP before 5.4.45, 5.5.x
 before 5.5.29, and 5.6.x before 5.6.13 does not properly manage headers,
 which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted
 serialized data that triggers a "type confusion" in the
 serialize_function_call function.
