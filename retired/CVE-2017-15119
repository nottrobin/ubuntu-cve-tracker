Description:
 The Network Block Device (NBD) server in Quick Emulator (QEMU) before 2.11
 is vulnerable to a denial of service issue. It could occur if a client sent
 large option requests, making the server waste CPU time on reading up to
 4GB per request. A client could use this flaw to keep the NBD server from
 serving other requests, resulting in DoS.
