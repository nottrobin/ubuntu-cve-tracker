Description:
 tif_getimage.c in LibTIFF 3.9.0 and 3.9.2 on 64-bit platforms, as used in
 ImageMagick, does not properly perform vertical flips, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image, related to "downsampled
 OJPEG input."
