Description:
 Chromedriver is an NPM wrapper for selenium ChromeDriver. Chromedriver
 before 2.26.1 downloads binary resources over HTTP, which leaves it
 vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote code
 execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested binary with an attacker
 controlled binary if the attacker is on the network or positioned in
 between the user and the remote server.
