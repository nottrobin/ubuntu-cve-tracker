Description:
 pam_ldap in nss_ldap on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, Fedora Core 3 and
 earlier, and possibly other distributions does not return an error
 condition when an LDAP directory server responds with a
 PasswordPolicyResponse control response, which causes the pam_authenticate
 function to return a success code even if authentication has failed, as
 originally reported for xscreensaver.
