Description:
 ownCloud Desktop Client before 2.0.1, when compiled with a Qt release after
 5.3.x, does not call QNetworkReply::ignoreSslErrors with the list of errors
 to be ignored, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
 man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks by leveraging a server using a self-signed
 certificate.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a partial
 CVE-2015-4456 regression.
