Candidate: CVE-2005-3300
References:
Description:
 The register_globals emulation layer in grab_globals.php for phpMyAdmin
 before 2.6.4-pl3 does not perform safety checks on values in the _FILES
 array for uploaded files, which allows remote attackers to include
 arbitrary files by using direct requests to library scripts that do not use
 grab_globals.php, then modifying certain configuration values for the
 theme.
