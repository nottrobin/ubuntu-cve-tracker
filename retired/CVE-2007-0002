Description:
 Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in WordPerfect Document
 importer/exporter (libwpd) before 0.8.9 allow user-assisted remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted WordPerfect file in which values to
 loop counters are not properly handled in the (1)
 WP3TablesGroup::_readContents and (2)
 WP5DefinitionGroup_DefineTablesSubGroup::WP5DefinitionGroup_DefineTablesSubGroup
 functions.  NOTE: the integer overflow has been split into CVE-2007-1466.
