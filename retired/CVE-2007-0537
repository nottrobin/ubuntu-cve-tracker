Description:
 The KDE HTML library (kdelibs), as used by Konqueror 3.5.5, does not
 properly parse HTML comments, which allows remote attackers to conduct
 cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and bypass some XSS protection schemes
 by embedding certain HTML tags within a comment in a title tag, a related
 issue to CVE-2007-0478.
