Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
 Utility). The supported version that is affected is Java SE: 11. Difficult
 to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network
 access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of
 this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete
 access to some of Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies
 to Java deployments that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes
 from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
 vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers,
 that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an
 administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.7 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the Utility component of OpenJDK did not
 properly ensure all attributes in a JAR were signed before use.
 An attacker could use this to specially construct an untrusted Java
 application or applet that could escape sandbox restrictions
