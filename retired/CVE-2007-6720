Description:
 libmikmod 3.1.9 through 3.2.0, as used by MikMod, SDL-mixer, and possibly
 other products, relies on the channel count of the last loaded song, rather
 than the currently playing song, for certain playback calculations, which
 allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) by loading multiple songs (aka MOD files) with different numbers of
 channels.
