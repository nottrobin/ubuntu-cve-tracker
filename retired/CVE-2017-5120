Description:
 Inappropriate use of www mismatch redirects in browser navigation in Google
 Chrome prior to 61.0.3163.79 for Mac, Windows, and Linux, and 61.0.3163.81
 for Android, allowed a remote attacker to potentially downgrade HTTPS
 requests to HTTP via a crafted HTML page. In other words, Chrome could
 transmit cleartext even though the user had entered an https URL, because
 of a misdesigned workaround for cases where the domain name in a URL almost
 matches the domain name in an X.509 server certificate (but differs in the
 initial "www." substring).
