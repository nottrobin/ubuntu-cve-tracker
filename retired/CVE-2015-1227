Description:
 The DragImage::create function in platform/DragImage.cpp in Blink, as used
 in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, does not initialize memory for image
 drawing, which allows remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by
 triggering a failed image decoding, as demonstrated by an image for which
 the default orientation cannot be used.
