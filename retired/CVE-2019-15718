Description:
 In systemd 240, bus_open_system_watch_bind_with_description in
 shared/bus-util.c (as used by systemd-resolved to connect to the system
 D-Bus instance), calls sd_bus_set_trusted, which disables access controls
 for incoming D-Bus messages. An unprivileged user can exploit this by
 executing D-Bus methods that should be restricted to privileged users, in
 order to change the system's DNS resolver settings.
