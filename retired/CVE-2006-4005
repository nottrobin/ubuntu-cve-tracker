Description:
 BomberClone 0.11.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (daemon crash) via (1) a certain malformed PKGF_ackreq packet,
 which triggers a crash in the rscache_add() function in pkgcache.c; and (2)
 an error packet, which is intended to be received by clients and force
 client shutdown, but also triggers server shutdown.
