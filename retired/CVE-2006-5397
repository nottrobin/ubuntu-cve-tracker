Description:
 The Xinput module (modules/im/ximcp/imLcIm.c) in X.Org libX11 1.0.2 and
 1.0.3 opens a file for reading twice using the same file descriptor, which
 causes a file descriptor leak that allows local users to read files
 specified by the XCOMPOSEFILE environment variable via the duplicate file
 descriptor.
