Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** plugins/demux/libmkv_plugin.dll in VideoLAN VLC Media Player
 2.0.7, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
 MKV file, possibly involving an integer overflow and out-of-bounds read or
 heap-based buffer overflow, or an uncaught exception.  NOTE: the vendor
 disputes the severity and claimed vulnerability type of this issue, stating
 "This PoC crashes VLC, indeed, but does nothing more... this is not an
 integer overflow error, but an uncaught exception and I doubt that it is
 exploitable. This uncaught exception makes VLC abort, not execute random
 code, on my Linux 64bits machine." A PoC posted by the original researcher
 shows signs of an attacker-controlled out-of-bounds read, but the affected
 instruction does not involve a register that directly influences control
 flow.
