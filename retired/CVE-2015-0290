Description:
 The multi-block feature in the ssl3_write_bytes function in s3_pkt.c in
 OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a on 64-bit x86 platforms with AES NI support
 does not properly handle certain non-blocking I/O cases, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (pointer corruption and
 application crash) via unspecified vectors.
