Description:
 In all versions of cpio before 2.13 does not properly validate input files
 when generating TAR archives. When cpio is used to create TAR archives from
 paths an attacker can write to, the resulting archive may contain files
 with permissions the attacker did not have or in paths he did not have
 access to. Extracting those archives from a high-privilege user without
 carefully reviewing them may lead to the compromise of the system.
