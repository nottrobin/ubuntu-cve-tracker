Description:
 lib/puppet/network/authstore.rb in Puppet before 2.7.18, and Puppet
 Enterprise before 2.5.2, supports use of IP addresses in certnames without
 warning of potential risks, which might allow remote attackers to spoof an
 agent by acquiring a previously used IP address.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> This would break existing installations. This will be fixed
 mdeslaur> in upstream 3.0. For 2.7, USN-1506-1 added a deprecation
 mdeslaur> warning.
 mdeslaur> Since this change would break existing installations, we will
 mdeslaur> not fix this in Ubuntu.
