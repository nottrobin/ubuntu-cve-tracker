Description:
 content/renderer/device_sensors/device_motion_event_pump.cc in Google
 Chrome before 41.0.2272.76 does not properly restrict access to high-rate
 accelerometer data, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture
 keystrokes via a crafted web site that listens for ondevicemotion events, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2015-1231.
