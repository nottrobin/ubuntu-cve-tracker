Description:
 Missing anchor in generated regex for rack-cors before 0.4.1 allows a
 malicious third-party site to perform CORS requests. If the configuration
 were intended to allow only the trusted example.com domain name and not the
 malicious example.net domain name, then example.com.example.net (as well as
 example.com-example.net) would be inadvertently allowed.
