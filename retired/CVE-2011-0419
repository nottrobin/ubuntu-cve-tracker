Description:
 Stack consumption vulnerability in the fnmatch implementation in
 apr_fnmatch.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library before 1.4.3 and
 the Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.18, and in fnmatch.c in libc in NetBSD
 5.1, OpenBSD 4.8, FreeBSD, Apple Mac OS X 10.6, Oracle Solaris 10, and
 Android, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
 (CPU and memory consumption) via *? sequences in the first argument, as
 demonstrated by attacks against mod_autoindex in httpd.
