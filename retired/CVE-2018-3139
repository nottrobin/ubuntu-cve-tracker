Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE
 (subcomponent: Networking). Supported versions that are affected are Java
 SE: 6u201, 7u191, 8u182 and 11; Java SE Embedded: 8u181. Difficult to
 exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access
 via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful
 attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker.
 Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read
 access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This
 vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running
 sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE
 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g. code that comes from the
 internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
 does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run
 only trusted code (e.g. code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base
 Score 3.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
Ubuntu-Description:
 Artem Smotrakov discovered that the HTTP client redirection handler
 implementation in OpenJDK did not clear potentially sensitive
 information in HTTP headers when following redirections to different
 hosts. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.
Notes:
 sbeattie> the release notes contain the following with respect to this
   issue:
     Better HTTP Redirection Support: In this release, the behavior of
     methods which application code uses to set request properties
     in java.net.HttpURLConnection has changed. When a redirect
     occurs automatically from the original destination server to
     a resource on a different server, then all such properties are
     cleared for the redirect and any subsequent redirects. If these
     properties are required to be set on the redirected requests,
     then the redirect responses should be handled by the application
     by calling HttpURLConnection.setInstanceFollowRedirects(false)
     for the original request.
