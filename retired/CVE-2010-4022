Description:
 The do_standalone function in the MIT krb5 KDC database propagation daemon
 (kpropd) in Kerberos 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9, when running in standalone mode,
 does not properly handle when a worker child process "exits abnormally,"
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (listening
 process termination, no new connections, and lack of updates in slave KVC)
 via unspecified vectors.
