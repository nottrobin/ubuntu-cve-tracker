Candidate: CVE-2007-1376

Description:
 The shmop functions in PHP before 4.4.5, and before 5.2.1 in the 5.x
 series, do not verify that their arguments correspond to a shmop resource,
 which allows context-dependent attackers to read and write arbitrary memory
 locations via arguments associated with an inappropriate resource, as
 demonstrated by a GD Image resource.
