Description:
 qutebrowser before version 1.4.1 is vulnerable to a cross-site request
 forgery flaw that allows websites to access 'qute://*' URLs. A malicious
 website could exploit this to load a 'qute://settings/set' URL, which then
 sets 'editor.command' to a bash script, resulting in arbitrary code
 execution.
