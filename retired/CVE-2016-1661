Description:
 Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 50.0.2661.94, does not ensure that
 frames satisfy a check for the same renderer process in addition to a Same
 Origin Policy check, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
 crafted web site, related to BindingSecurity.cpp and DOMWindow.cpp.
