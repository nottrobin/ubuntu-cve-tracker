Description:
 OpenSSL 1.0.2 (starting from version 1.0.2b) introduced an "error state"
 mechanism. The intent was that if a fatal error occurred during a handshake
 then OpenSSL would move into the error state and would immediately fail if
 you attempted to continue the handshake. This works as designed for the
 explicit handshake functions (SSL_do_handshake(), SSL_accept() and
 SSL_connect()), however due to a bug it does not work correctly if
 SSL_read() or SSL_write() is called directly. In that scenario, if the
 handshake fails then a fatal error will be returned in the initial function
 call. If SSL_read()/SSL_write() is subsequently called by the application
 for the same SSL object then it will succeed and the data is passed without
 being decrypted/encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer. In order
 to exploit this issue an application bug would have to be present that
 resulted in a call to SSL_read()/SSL_write() being issued after having
 already received a fatal error. OpenSSL version 1.0.2b-1.0.2m are affected.
 Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2n. OpenSSL 1.1.0 is not affected.

Notes: 
 leosilva> this issue does not affect OpenSSL 1.1.0
 mdeslaur> 1.0.2b introduced a security hardening mechanism designed to

 mdeslaur> This CVE applies to the hardening mechanism being incomplete.
 mdeslaur> openssl versions older than 1.0.2b don't have the hardening
 mdeslaur> mechanism at all.
