Description:
 ecryptfs-setup-swap in eCryptfs does not prevent the unencrypted swap
 partition from activating during boot when using GPT partitioning on a (1)
 NVMe or (2) MMC drive, which allows local users to obtain sensitive
 information via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
 because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-8946.
