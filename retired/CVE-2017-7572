Description:
 The _checkPolkitPrivilege function in serviceHelper.py in Back In Time (aka
 backintime) 1.1.18 and earlier uses a deprecated polkit authorization
 method (unix-process) that is subject to a race condition (time of check,
 time of use). With this authorization method, the owner of a process
 requesting a polkit operation is checked by polkitd via /proc/<pid>/status,
 by which time the requesting process may have been replaced by a different
 process with the same PID that has different privileges then the original
 requester.
