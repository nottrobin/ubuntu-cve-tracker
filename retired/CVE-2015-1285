Description:
 The XSSAuditor::canonicalize function in core/html/parser/XSSAuditor.cpp in
 the XSS auditor in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 44.0.2403.89,
 does not properly choose a truncation point, which makes it easier for
 remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via an unspecified
 linear-time attack.
