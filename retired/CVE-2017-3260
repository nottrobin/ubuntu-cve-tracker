Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
 AWT). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u121 and 8u112.
 Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
 network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful
 attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and
 while the vulnerability is in Java SE, attacks may significantly impact
 additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
 takeover of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
 typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or
 sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that
 comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
 vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers,
 that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an
 administrator). CVSS v3.0 Base Score 8.3 (Confidentiality, Integrity and
 Availability impacts).
