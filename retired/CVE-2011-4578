Description:
 event.c in acpid (aka acpid2) before 2.0.11 does not have an appropriate
 umask setting during execution of event-handler scripts, which might allow
 local users to (1) perform write operations within directories created by a
 script, or (2) read files created by a script, via standard filesystem
 system calls.
