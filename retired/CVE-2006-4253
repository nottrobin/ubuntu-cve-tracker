Description:
 Concurrency vulnerability in Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.6 and earlier allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via multiple Javascript timed events that load a deeply
 nested XML file, followed by redirecting the browser to another page, which
 leads to a concurrency failure that causes structures to be freed
 incorrectly, as demonstrated by (1) ffoxdie and (2) ffoxdie3.  NOTE: it has
 been reported that Netscape 8.1 and K-Meleon 1.0.1 are also affected by
 ffoxdie.  Mozilla confirmed to CVE that ffoxdie and ffoxdie3 trigger the
 same underlying vulnerability.  NOTE: it was later reported that Firefox
 2.0 RC2 and 1.5.0.7 are also affected.
