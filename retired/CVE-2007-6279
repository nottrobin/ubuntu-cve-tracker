Description:
 Multiple double free vulnerabilities in Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)
 libFLAC before 1.2.1 allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code via malformed (1) Seektable values or (2) Seektable Data
 Offsets in a .FLAC file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> iDefense information had virtually no details, however the Ubuntu
   fix for CVE-2007-4619 has several seektable checks before free, so I am
   marking this as fixed.
 jdstrand> note that CVE-2007-4619 was very general and came out before the
   iDefense CVEs, so there is overlap
