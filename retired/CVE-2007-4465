Description:
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in mod_autoindex.c in the Apache
 HTTP Server before 2.2.6, when the charset on a server-generated page is
 not defined, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML
 via the P parameter using the UTF-7 charset.  NOTE: it could be argued that
 this issue is due to a design limitation of browsers that attempt to
 perform automatic content type detection.
