Description:
 The wmem_block_split_free_chunk function in
 epan/wmem/wmem_allocator_block.c in the wmem block allocator in the memory
 manager in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.7 does not properly consider a
 certain case of multiple realloc operations that restore a memory chunk to
 its original size, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (incorrect free operation and application crash) via a crafted
 packet.
