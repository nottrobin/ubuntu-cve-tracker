Description:
 ProFTPD 1.3.1 interprets long commands from an FTP client as multiple
 commands, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request
 forgery (CSRF) attacks and execute arbitrary FTP commands via a long ftp://
 URI that leverages an existing session from the FTP client implementation
 in a web browser.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 stefanlsd> After discussion with Francesco Paolo Lovergine <frankie@debian.org>
   we concluded that this bug does not affect the Debian or Ubuntu versions of
   proftpd 1.3.1 or earlier. We believe the problems that this CVE affects were only
   introduced in the proftpd 1.3.2rc series. The exploit as found in the Bugs section
   was independently tested and shown to not apply.
