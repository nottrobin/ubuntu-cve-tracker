Description:
 A vulnerability in LibreOffice hyperlink processing allows an attacker to
 construct documents containing hyperlinks pointing to the location of an
 executable on the target users file system. If the hyperlink is activated
 by the victim the executable target is unconditionally launched. Under
 Windows and macOS when processing a hyperlink target explicitly activated
 by the user there was no judgment made on whether the target was an
 executable file, so such executable targets were launched unconditionally.
 This issue affects: All LibreOffice Windows and macOS versions prior to
 6.1.6; LibreOffice Windows and macOS versions in the 6.2 series prior to
 6.2.3.
