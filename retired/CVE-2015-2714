Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 38.0 on Android does not properly restrict writing
 URL data to the Android logging system, which allows attackers to obtain
 sensitive information via a crafted application that has a required
 permission for reading a log, as demonstrated by the READ_LOGS permission
 for the mixed-content violation log on Android 4.0 and earlier.
