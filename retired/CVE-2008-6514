Description:
 The Expo plugin in Compiz Fusion 0.7.8 allows local users with physical
 access to drag the screen saver aside and access the locked desktop by
 using Expo mouse shortcuts, a related issue to CVE-2007-3920.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the Expo plugin for Compiz did not correctly
 restrict the screensaver window from being moved with the mouse. A local
 attacker could use the mouse to move the screensaver off the screen and
 gain access to the locked desktop session underneath. Default installs
 of Ubuntu were not vulnerable as Expo does not come pre-configured with
 mouse bindings.
