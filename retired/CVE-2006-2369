Description:
 RealVNC 4.1.1, and other products that use RealVNC such as AdderLink IP and
 Cisco CallManager, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a
 request in which the client specifies an insecure security type such as
 "Type 1 - None", which is accepted even if it is not offered by the server,
 as originally demonstrated using a long password.
