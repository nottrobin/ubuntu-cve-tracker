Description:
 ppm2tiff does not check the return value of the TIFFScanlineSize function,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PPM image that triggers an
 integer overflow, a zero-memory allocation, and a heap-based buffer
 overflow.
