Description:
 GUI display truncation vulnerability in Mozilla Thunderbird 1.0.2, 1.0.6,
 and 1.0.7 allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via an
 attachment with a filename containing a large number of spaces ending with
 a dangerous extension that is not displayed by Thunderbird, along with an
 inconsistent Content-Type header, which could be used to trick a user into
 downloading dangerous content by dragging or saving the attachment.
