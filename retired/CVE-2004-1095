Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in (1) readbmp.c, (2) readgif.c, (3) readgif.c,
 (4) readmrf.c, (5) readpcx.c, (6) readpng.c,(7) readpnm.c, (8) readprf.c,
 (9) readtiff.c, (10) readxbm.c, (11) readxpm.c in zgv 5.8 allow remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain image headers that cause
 calculations to be overflowed and small buffers to be allocated, leading to
 buffer overflows.  NOTE: CVE-2004-0994 and CVE-2004-1095 identify sets of
 bugs that only partially overlap, despite having the same developer.
 Therefore, they should be regarded as distinct.
