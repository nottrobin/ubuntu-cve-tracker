Description:
 Double free vulnerability in the authentication and authentication token
 alteration code in PAM-MySQL 0.6.x before 0.6.2 and 0.7.x before 0.7pre3
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash)
 and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted passwords, which lead to a
 double free of a pointer that was created by the pam_get_item function. 
 NOTE: this issue only occurs in certain configurations in which there are
 multiple PAM modules, PAM-MySQL is not evaluated first, and there are no
 requisite modules before PAM-MySQL.
