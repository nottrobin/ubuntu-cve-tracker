Description:
 When the checkWithPolicy method is called by the
 EJBJACCPolicyModuleDelegate class during authorization, the current
 roles are always determined using the caller principal even when a
 runAs principal exists. As a result, if the @RunAs annotation is used,
 the current roles will only include those of the caller principal, and
 those specificed in the @RunAs annotation will be ignored when
 authorization is performed.
