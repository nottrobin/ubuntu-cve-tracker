Description:
 An issue was discovered in phpLiteAdmin 1.9.5 through 1.9.7.1. Due to loose
 comparison with '==' instead of '===' in classes/Authorization.php for the
 user-provided login password, it is possible to login with a simpler
 password if the password has the form of a power in scientific notation
 (like '2e2' for '200' or '0e1234' for '0'). This is possible because, in
 the loose comparison case, PHP interprets the string as a number in
 scientific notation, and thus converts it to a number. After that, the
 comparison with '==' casts the user input (e.g., the string '200' or '0')
 to a number, too. Hence the attacker can login with just a '0' or a simple
 number he has to brute force. Strong comparison with '===' prevents the
 cast into numbers.
