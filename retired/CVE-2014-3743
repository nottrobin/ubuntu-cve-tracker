Description:
 Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Marked module
 before 0.3.1 for Node.js allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
 script or HTML via vectors related to (1) gfm codeblocks (language) or (2)
 javascript url's.

 sanitize: true

 Even if this option is set, marked is vulnerable to content injection in multiple locations if untrusted user input is allowed to be provided into marked and that output is passed to the browser.

 Injection is possible in two locations

  * gfm codeblocks (language)
  * javascript url's
