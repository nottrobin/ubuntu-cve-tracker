Description:
 The (1) bundled GnuTLS SSL/TLS plugin and the (2) bundled OpenSSL SSL/TLS
 plugin in libpurple in Pidgin before 2.10.10 do not properly consider the
 Basic Constraints extension during verification of X.509 certificates from
 SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and
 obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.
