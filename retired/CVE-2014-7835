Description:
 webservice/upload.php in Moodle 2.6.x before 2.6.6 and 2.7.x before 2.7.3
 does not ensure that a file upload is for a private or draft area, which
 allows remote authenticated users to upload files containing JavaScript,
 and consequently conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, by specifying
 the profile-picture area.
