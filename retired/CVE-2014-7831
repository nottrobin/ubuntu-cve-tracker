Description:
 lib/classes/grades_external.php in Moodle 2.7.x before 2.7.3 does not
 consider the moodle/grade:viewhidden capability before displaying hidden
 grades, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive
 information by leveraging the student role to access the get_grades web
 service.
