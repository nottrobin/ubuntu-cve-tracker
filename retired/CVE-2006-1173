Description:
 Sendmail before 8.13.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 via deeply nested, malformed multipart MIME messages that exhaust the stack
 during the recursive mime8to7 function for performing 8-bit to 7-bit
 conversion, which prevents Sendmail from delivering queued messages and
 might lead to disk consumption by core dump files.
