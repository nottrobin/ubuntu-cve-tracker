Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The AES-GCM specification in RFC 5084, as used in Android
 5.x and 6.x, recommends 12 octets for the aes-ICVlen parameter field, which
 might make it easier for attackers to defeat a cryptographic protection
 mechanism and discover an authentication key via a crafted application, aka
 internal bug 26234568.  NOTE: The vendor disputes the existence of this
 potential issue in Android, stating "This CVE was raised in error: it
 referred to the authentication tag size in GCM, whose default according to
 ASN.1 encoding (12 bytes) can lead to vulnerabilities. After careful
 consideration, it was decided that the insecure default value of 12 bytes
 was a default only for the encoding and not default anywhere else in
 Android, and hence no vulnerability existed."
