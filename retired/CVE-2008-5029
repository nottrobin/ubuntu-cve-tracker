Description:
 The __scm_destroy function in net/core/scm.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.27.4,
 2.6.26, and earlier makes indirect recursive calls to itself through calls
 to the fput function, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
 (panic) via vectors related to sending an SCM_RIGHTS message through a UNIX
 domain socket and closing file descriptors.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the Unix Socket handler did not correctly process
 the SCM_RIGHTS message.  A local attacker could make a malicious socket
 request that would crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
