Description:
 The remote API in Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier at
 /computer/(agent-name)/api showed information about tasks (typically
 builds) currently running on that agent. This included information about
 tasks that the current user otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to lack of
 Item/Read permission. This has been fixed, and the API now only shows
 information about accessible tasks.
