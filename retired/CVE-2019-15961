Description:
 A vulnerability in the email parsing module Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV)
 Software versions 0.102.0, 0.101.4 and prior could allow an
 unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on
 an affected device. The vulnerability is due to inefficient MIME parsing
 routines that result in extremely long scan times of specially formatted
 email files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
 crafted email file to an affected device. An exploit could allow the
 attacker to cause the ClamAV scanning process to scan the crafted email
 file indefinitely, resulting in a denial of service condition.
