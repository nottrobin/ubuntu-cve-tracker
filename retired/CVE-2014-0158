Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the JPEG2000 image tile decoder in OpenJPEG
 before 1.5.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
 file because of incorrect j2k_decode, j2k_read_eoc, and tcd_decode_tile
 interaction, a related issue to CVE-2013-6045. NOTE: this is not a
 duplicate of CVE-2013-1447, because the scope of CVE-2013-1447 was
 specifically defined in http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2013/12/04/6
 as only "null pointer dereferences, division by zero, and anything that
 would just fit as DoS."
