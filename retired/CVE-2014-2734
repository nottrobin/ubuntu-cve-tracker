Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The openssl extension in Ruby 2.x does not properly maintain
 the state of process memory after a file is reopened, which allows remote
 attackers to spoof signatures within the context of a Ruby script that
 attempts signature verification after performing a certain sequence of
 filesystem operations.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Ruby
 OpenSSL team and third parties, who state that the original demonstration
 PoC contains errors and redundant or unnecessarily-complex code that does
 not appear to be related to a demonstration of the issue. As of 20140502,
 CVE is not aware of any public comment by the original researcher.
