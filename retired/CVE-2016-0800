Description:
 The SSLv2 protocol, as used in OpenSSL before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before
 1.0.2g and other products, requires a server to send a ServerVerify message
 before establishing that a client possesses certain plaintext RSA data,
 which makes it easier for remote attackers to decrypt TLS ciphertext data
 by leveraging a Bleichenbacher RSA padding oracle, aka a "DROWN" attack.
