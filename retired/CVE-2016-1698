Description:
 The createCustomType function in extensions/renderer/resources/binding.js
 in the extension bindings in Google Chrome before 51.0.2704.79 does not
 validate module types, which might allow attackers to load arbitrary
 modules or obtain sensitive information by leveraging a poisoned
 definition.
