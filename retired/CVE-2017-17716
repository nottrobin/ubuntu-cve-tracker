Description:
 GitLab 9.4.x before 9.4.2 does not support LDAP SSL certificate
 verification, but a verify_certificates LDAP option was mentioned in the
 9.4 release announcement. This issue occurred because code was not merged.
 This is related to use of the omniauth-ldap library and the
 gitlab_omniauth-ldap gem.
