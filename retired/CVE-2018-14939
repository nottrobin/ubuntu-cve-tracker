Description:
 The get_app_path function in desktop/unx/source/start.c in LibreOffice
 through 6.0.5 mishandles the realpath function in certain environments such
 as FreeBSD libc, which might allow attackers to cause a denial of service
 (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact if LibreOffice is automatically launched during web browsing with
 pathnames controlled by a remote web site.
