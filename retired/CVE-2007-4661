Description:
 The chunk_split function in string.c in PHP 5.2.3 does not properly
 calculate the needed buffer size due to precision loss when performing
 integer arithmetic with floating point numbers, which has unknown attack
 vectors and impact, possibly resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. 
 NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-2872.
