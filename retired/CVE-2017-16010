Description:
 i18next is a language translation framework. When using the .init method,
 passing interpolation options without passing an escapeValue will default
 to undefined rather than the assumed true. This can result in a cross-site
 scripting vulnerability because user input is assumed to be escaped, but is
 not. This vulnerability affects i18next 2.0.0 and later.
