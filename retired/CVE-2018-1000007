Description:
 libcurl 7.1 through 7.57.0 might accidentally leak authentication data to
 third parties. When asked to send custom headers in its HTTP requests,
 libcurl will send that set of headers first to the host in the initial URL
 but also, if asked to follow redirects and a 30X HTTP response code is
 returned, to the host mentioned in URL in the `Location:` response header
 value. Sending the same set of headers to subsequent hosts is in particular
 a problem for applications that pass on custom `Authorization:` headers, as
 this header often contains privacy sensitive information or data that could
 allow others to impersonate the libcurl-using client's request.
