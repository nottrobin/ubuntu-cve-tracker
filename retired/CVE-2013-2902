Description:
 Use-after-free vulnerability in the XSLT ProcessingInstruction
 implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 29.0.1547.57,
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via vectors related to an applyXSLTransform call
 involving (1) an HTML document or (2) an xsl:processing-instruction element
 that is still in the process of loading.
