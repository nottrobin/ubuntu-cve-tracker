Description:
 The default configuration of ISC BIND, when configured as a caching name
 server, allows recursive queries and provides additional delegation
 information to arbitrary IP addresses, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via DNS queries with
 spoofed source IP addresses.
