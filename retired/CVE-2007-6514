Description:
 Apache HTTP Server, when running on Linux with a document root on a Windows
 share mounted using smbfs, allows remote attackers to obtain unprocessed
 content such as source files for .php programs via a trailing "\"
 (backslash), which is not handled by the intended AddType directive.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 kees> should this be considered a bug in smbfs instead?
 mdeslaur> It is a bug in smbfs...but kernel versions we have are not vulnerable
 mdeslaur> open("/mnt/test/hosts.php\\", O_RDONLY) = -1 EINVAL (Invalid argument)
 mdeslaur> tested on Dapper, so we're not affected
