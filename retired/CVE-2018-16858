Description:
 It was found that libreoffice before versions 6.0.7 and 6.1.3 was
 vulnerable to a directory traversal attack which could be used to execute
 arbitrary macros bundled with a document. An attacker could craft a
 document, which when opened by LibreOffice, would execute a Python method
 from a script in any arbitrary file system location, specified relative to
 the LibreOffice install location.
