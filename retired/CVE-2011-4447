Description:
 The "encrypt wallet" feature in wxBitcoin and bitcoind 0.4.x before 0.4.1,
 and 0.5.0rc, does not properly interact with the deletion functionality of
 BSDDB, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain unencrypted
 private keys from Bitcoin wallet files by bypassing the BSDDB interface and
 reading entries that are marked for deletion.
