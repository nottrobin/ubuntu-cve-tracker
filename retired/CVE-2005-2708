Candidate: CVE-2005-2708
References:
Description:
 The search_binary_handler function in exec.c in Linux 2.4 kernel on 64-bit
 x86 architectures does not check a return code for a particular function
 call when virtual memory is low, which allows local users to cause a denial
 of service (panic), as demonstrated by running a process using the bash
 ulimit -v command.
