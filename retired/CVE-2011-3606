Description:
 A DOM based cross-site scripting flaw was found in the JBoss Application
 Server 7 before 7.1.0 Beta 1 administration console. A remote attacker
 could provide a specially-crafted web page and trick the valid JBoss AS
 user, with the administrator privilege, to visit it, which would lead into
 the DOM environment modification and arbitrary HTML or web script
 execution.
