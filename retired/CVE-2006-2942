Description:
 TWiki 4.0.0, 4.0.1, and 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to gain Twiki
 administrator privileges via a TWiki.TWikiRegistration form with a modified
 action attribute that references the Sandbox web instead of the user web,
 which can then be used to associate the user's login name with the WikiName
 of a member of the TWikiAdminGroup.
