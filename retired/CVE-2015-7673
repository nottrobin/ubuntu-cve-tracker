Description:
 io-tga.c in gdk-pixbuf before 2.32.0 uses heap memory after its allocation
 failed, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted Truevision TGA (TARGA) file.

 mdeslaur> this is actually fixed in 2.32.0, not 2.32.1
