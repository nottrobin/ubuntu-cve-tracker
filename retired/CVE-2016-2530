Description:
 The dissct_rsl_ipaccess_msg function in epan/dissectors/packet-rsl.c in the
 RSL dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.10 and 2.0.x before 2.0.2
 mishandles the case of an unrecognized TLV type, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application
 crash) via a crafted packet, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-2531.
