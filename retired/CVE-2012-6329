Description:
 The _compile function in Maketext.pm in the Locale::Maketext implementation
 in Perl before 5.17.7 does not properly handle backslashes and fully
 qualified method names during compilation of bracket notation, which allows
 context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary commands via crafted input
 to an application that accepts translation strings from users, as
 demonstrated by the TWiki application before 5.1.3, and the Foswiki
 application 1.0.x through 1.0.10 and 1.1.x through 1.1.6.
