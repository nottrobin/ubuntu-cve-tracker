Description:
 Memory leak in the dtls1_buffer_record function in d1_pkt.c in OpenSSL
 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by sending many duplicate
 records for the next epoch, leading to failure of replay detection.
