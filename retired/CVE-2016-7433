Description:
 NTP before 4.2.8p9 does not properly perform the initial sync calculations,
 which allows remote attackers to unspecified impact via unknown vectors,
 related to a "root distance that did not include the peer dispersion."
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> ntp-4.2.7p385, up to but not including ntp-4.2.8p9, and
 mdeslaur> ntp-4.3.0 up to, but not including ntp-4.3.94. But the
 mdeslaur> root-distance calculation in general is incorrect in all
 mdeslaur> versions of ntp-4 until this release.
 leosilva> for precise it's not needed since this issue seems to
 leosilva> be caused by some regression and precise hasn't the
 leosilva> code affect changed.
 mdeslaur> trusty isn't vulnerable either
