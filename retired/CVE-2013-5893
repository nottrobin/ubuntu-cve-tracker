Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 7u45 and Java SE Embedded 7u45,
 and OpenJDK 7, allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality,
 integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Libraries.
 NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2014 CPU. Oracle has not
 commented on third-party claims that the issue is related to improper

 to escape the sandbox.
