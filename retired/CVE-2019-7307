Description:
 Apport before versions 2.14.1-0ubuntu3.29+esm1, 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.19,
 2.20.9-0ubuntu7.7, 2.20.10-0ubuntu27.1, 2.20.11-0ubuntu5 contained a
 TOCTTOU vulnerability when reading the users ~/.apport-ignore.xml file,
 which allows a local attacker to replace this file with a symlink to any
 other file on the system and so cause Apport to include the contents of
 this other file in the resulting crash report. The crash report could then
 be read by that user either by causing it to be uploaded and reported to
 Launchpad, or by leveraging some other vulnerability to read the resulting
 crash report, and so allow the user to read arbitrary files on the system.
