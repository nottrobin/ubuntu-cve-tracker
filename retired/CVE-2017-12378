Description:
 ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability
 that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
 service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to
 improper input validation checking mechanisms of .tar (Tape Archive) files
 sent to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause a checksum
 buffer over-read condition when ClamAV scans the malicious .tar file,
 potentially allowing the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected
 device.
