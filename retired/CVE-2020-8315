Description:
 In Python (CPython) 3.6 through 3.6.10, 3.7 through 3.7.6, and 3.8 through
 3.8.1, an insecure dependency load upon launch on Windows 7 may result in
 an attacker's copy of api-ms-win-core-path-l1-1-0.dll being loaded and used
 instead of the system's copy. Windows 8 and later are unaffected.
