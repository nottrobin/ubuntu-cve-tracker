Description:
 Integer overflow in util.c in mod_dav_svn in Apache Subversion 1.7.x, 1.8.x
 before 1.8.15, and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 allows remote authenticated users to
 cause a denial of service (subversion server crash or memory consumption)
 and possibly execute arbitrary code via a skel-encoded request body, which
 triggers an out-of-bounds read and heap-based buffer overflow.
