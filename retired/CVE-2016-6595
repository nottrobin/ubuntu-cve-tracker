Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The SwarmKit toolkit 1.12.0 for Docker allows remote
 authenticated users to cause a denial of service (prevention of cluster
 joins) via a long sequence of join and quit actions.  NOTE: the vendor
 disputes this issue, stating that this sequence is not "removing the state
 that is left by old nodes. At some point the manager obviously stops being
 able to accept new nodes, since it runs out of memory. Given that both for
 Docker swarm and for Docker Swarmkit nodes are *required* to provide a
 secret token (it's actually the only mode of operation), this means that no
 adversary can simply join nodes and exhaust manager resources. We can't do
 anything about a manager running out of memory and not being able to add
 new legitimate nodes to the system. This is merely a resource provisioning
 issue, and definitely not a CVE worthy vulnerability."
