Description:
 curl, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 before version 7.19.7-53,
 did not correctly backport the fix for CVE-2015-3148 because it did not
 reflect the fact that the HAVE_GSSAPI define was meanwhile substituted by
 USE_HTTP_NEGOTIATE. This issue was introduced in RHEL 6.7 and affects RHEL
 6 curl only.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Is an issue in Red Hat's backport as their old version doesn't
 mdeslaur> have USE_HTTP_NEGOTIATE. Doesn't affect precise and newer.
