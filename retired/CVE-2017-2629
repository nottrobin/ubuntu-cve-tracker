 https://curl.haxx.se/docs/adv_20170222.html
Description:
 curl before 7.53.0 has an incorrect TLS Certificate Status Request
 extension feature that asks for a fresh proof of the server's certificate's
 validity in the code that checks for a test success or failure. It ends up
 always thinking there's valid proof, even when there is none or if the
 server doesn't support the TLS extension in question. This could lead to
 users not detecting when a server's certificate goes invalid or otherwise
 be mislead that the server is in a better shape than it is in reality. This
 flaw also exists in the command line tool (--cert-status).
