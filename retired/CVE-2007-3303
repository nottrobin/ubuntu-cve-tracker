Description:
 Apache httpd 2.0.59 and 2.2.4, with the Prefork MPM module, allows local
 users to cause a denial of service via certain code sequences executed in a
 worker process that (1) stop request processing by killing all worker
 processes and preventing creation of replacements or (2) hang the system by
 forcing the master process to fork an arbitrarily large number of worker
 processes.  NOTE: This might be an inherent design limitation of Apache
 with respect to worker processes in hosted environments.

Notes: 
 kees> design problem, but only a DoS during arbitrary code exec, which would be the real issue
