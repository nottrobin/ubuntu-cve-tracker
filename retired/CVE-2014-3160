Description:
 The ResourceFetcher::canRequest function in core/fetch/ResourceFetcher.cpp
 in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 36.0.1985.125, does not properly
 restrict subresource requests associated with SVG files, which allows
 remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted file.
