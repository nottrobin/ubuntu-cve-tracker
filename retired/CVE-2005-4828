Candidate: CVE-2005-4828
References:
Description:
 Kolab Server 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 does not properly handle when a large email is
 sent with a "." in the wrong place, which causes kolabfilter to add another
 ".", which might break clear-text signatures and attachments.  NOTE: it is
 not clear whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries, so this might
 not be a vulnerability.
