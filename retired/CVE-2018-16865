Description:
 An allocation of memory without limits, that could result in the stack
 clashing with another memory region, was discovered in systemd-journald
 when many entries are sent to the journal socket. A local attacker, or a
 remote one if systemd-journal-remote is used, may use this flaw to crash
 systemd-journald or execute code with journald privileges. Versions through
 v240 are vulnerable.
