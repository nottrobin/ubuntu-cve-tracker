Description:
 An error in zone database reference counting can lead to an assertion
 failure if a server which is running an affected version of BIND attempts
 several transfers of a slave zone in quick succession. This defect could be
 deliberately exercised by an attacker who is permitted to cause a
 vulnerable server to initiate zone transfers (for example: by sending valid
 NOTIFY messages), causing the named process to exit after failing the
 assertion test. Affects BIND 9.12.0 and 9.12.1.
