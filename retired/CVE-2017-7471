Description:
 Quick Emulator (Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via
 Plan 9 File System (9pfs) support, is vulnerable to an improper access
 control issue. It could occur while accessing files on a shared host
 directory. A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to access
 host file system beyond the shared folder and potentially escalating their
 privileges on a host.
