Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE
 (subcomponent: Hotspot). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE:
 7u121 and 8u112; Java SE Embedded: 8u111. Easily exploitable vulnerability
 allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols
 to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human
 interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the
 vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly
 impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can
 result in takeover of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability
 applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java
 Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run
 untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the
 Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java
 deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code
 (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS v3.0 Base Score 9.6
 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts).
