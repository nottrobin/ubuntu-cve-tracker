Description:
 Directory traversal vulnerability in Apache Tomcat 4.1.0 through 4.1.37,
 5.5.0 through 5.5.26, and 6.0.0 through 6.0.16, when allowLinking and UTF-8
 are enabled, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via encoded
 directory traversal sequences in the URI, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2008-2370.  NOTE: versions earlier than 6.0.18 were reported affected,
 but the vendor advisory lists 6.0.16 as the last affected version.
