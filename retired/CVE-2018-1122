Description:
 procps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to a local privilege
 escalation in top. If a user runs top with HOME unset in an
 attacker-controlled directory, the attacker could achieve privilege
 escalation by exploiting one of several vulnerabilities in the
 config_file() function.
