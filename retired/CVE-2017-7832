Description:
 The combined, single character, version of the letter 'i' with any of the
 potential accents in unicode, such as acute or grave, can be spoofed in the
 addressbar by the dotless version of 'i' followed by the same accent as a
 second character with most font sets. This allows for domain spoofing
 attacks because these combined domain names do not display as punycode.
 This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57.
