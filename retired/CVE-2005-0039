Candidate: CVE-2005-0039
References:
Description:
 Certain configurations of IPsec, when using Encapsulating Security Payload
 (ESP) in tunnel mode, integrity protection at a higher layer, or
 Authentication Header (AH), allow remote attackers to decrypt IPSec
 communications by modifying the outer packet in ways that cause plaintext
 data from the inner packet to be returned in ICMP messages, as demonstrated
 using bit-flipping attacks and (1) Destination Address Rewriting, (2) a
 modified header length that causes portions of the packet to be interpreted
 as IP Options, or (3) a modified protocol field and source address.
