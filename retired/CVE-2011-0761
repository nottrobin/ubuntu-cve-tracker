Description:
 Perl 5.10.x allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
 (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) by leveraging an ability
 to inject arguments into a (1) getpeername, (2) readdir, (3) closedir, (4)
 getsockname, (5) rewinddir, (6) tell, or (7) telldir function call.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> toucan systems advisory has PoC
 sarnold> ignoring this CVE: flaw requires extremely poorly written software
   to exploit the problem (allow input to modify the number of arguments
   to fundamental functions), crashes do not appear to be under argument
   control. Upstream Perl team does not consider it a security-relevant
   problem and thus have not prepared any patches.
