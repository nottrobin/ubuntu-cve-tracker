Description:
 gnome-power-manager 2.27.92 does not properly implement the lock_on_suspend
 and lock_on_hibernate settings for locking the screen when the suspend or
 hibernate button is pressed, which might make it easier for physically
 proximate attackers to access an unattended laptop via a resume action, a
 related issue to CVE-2010-2532.  NOTE: this issue exists because of a
 regression that followed a gnome-power-manager fix a few years earlier.
