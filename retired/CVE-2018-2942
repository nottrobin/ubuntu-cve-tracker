 8u172. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker
 with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE.
 Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the
 attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, attacks may
 significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this
 vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE. Note: Applies to client
 and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through
 sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can
 also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component
 without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java
 applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.3
