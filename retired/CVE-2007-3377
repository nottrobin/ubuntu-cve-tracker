Description:
 Header.pm in Net::DNS before 0.60, a Perl module, (1) generates predictable
 sequence IDs with a fixed increment and (2) can use the same starting ID
 for all child processes of a forking server, which allows remote attackers
 to spoof DNS responses, as originally reported for qpsmtp and spamassassin.
