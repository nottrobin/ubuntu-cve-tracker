Description:
 The elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) subsystem in OpenSSL 1.0.0d and
 earlier, when the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) is
 used for the ECDHE_ECDSA cipher suite, does not properly implement curves
 over binary fields, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers
 to determine private keys via a timing attack and a lattice calculation.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> from upstream: "The OpenSSL team have reviewed the paper, and
  although the result is significant, we believe that the affected code (ECDSA
  used with binary curves) is very rarely used at present. We therefore do not
  plan on issuing a security release but expect to patch this in the future."
