Description:
 The dissect_capwap_data function in epan/dissectors/packet-capwap.c in the
 CAPWAP dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.16 and 1.8.x before 1.8.8
 incorrectly uses a -1 data value to represent an error condition, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash)
 via a crafted packet.
