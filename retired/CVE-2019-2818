Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
 Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 11.0.3 and
 12.0.1. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker
 with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE.
 Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the
 attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
 unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE accessible data. Note: This
 vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running
 sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE
 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
 internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
 does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run
 only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base
 Score 3.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the ChaCha20Cipher implementation in OpenJDK
 did not use constant time computations in some situations. An attacker
 could use this to expose sensitive information.
