Description:
 browser/ui/website_settings/website_settings.cc in Google Chrome before
 42.0.2311.90 does not always display "Media: Allowed by you" in a
 Permissions table after the user has granted camera permission to a web
 site, which might make it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to
 obtain sensitive video data from a device's physical environment via a
 crafted web site that turns on the camera at a time when the user believes
 that camera access is prohibited.
