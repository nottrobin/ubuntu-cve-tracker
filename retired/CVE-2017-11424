Description:
 In PyJWT 1.5.0 and below the `invalid_strings` check in
 `HMACAlgorithm.prepare_key` does not account for all PEM encoded public
 keys. Specifically, the PKCS1 PEM encoded format would be allowed because
 it is prefaced with the string `-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----` which is
 not accounted for. This enables symmetric/asymmetric key confusion attacks
 against users using the PKCS1 PEM encoded public keys, which would allow an
 attacker to craft JWTs from scratch.
