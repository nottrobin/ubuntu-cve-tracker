Description:
 Python Cryptographic Authority pyopenssl version Before 17.5.0 contains a
 CWE - 401 : Failure to Release Memory Before Removing Last Reference
 vulnerability in PKCS #12 Store that can result in Denial of service if
 memory runs low or is exhausted. This attack appear to be exploitable via
 Depends upon calling application, however it could be as simple as
 initiating a TLS connection. Anything that would cause the calling
 application to reload certificates from a PKCS #12 store.. This
 vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 17.5.0.
