Description:
 The file-upload implementation in rfc1867.c in PHP before 5.4.0 does not
 properly handle invalid [ (open square bracket) characters in name values,
 which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (malformed $_FILES indexes) or conduct directory traversal attacks during
 multi-file uploads by leveraging a script that lacks its own filename
 restrictions.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> some argue bug is in script, not the language, but PHP does try
  to sanitize $_FILES. Script writers may be relying on that.
