Description:
 Spring Framework, versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior to
 4.3.15 and older unsupported versions, allow applications to configure
 Spring MVC to serve static resources (e.g. CSS, JS, images). When static
 resources are served from a file system on Windows (as opposed to the
 classpath, or the ServletContext), a malicious user can send a request
 using a specially crafted URL that can lead a directory traversal attack.
