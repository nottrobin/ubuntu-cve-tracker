Description:
 Multiple format string vulnerabilities in FlightGear 2.6 and earlier and
 SimGear 2.6 and earlier allow user-assisted remote attackers to cause a

 specifiers in certain data chunk values in an aircraft xml model to (1)
 fgfs/flightgear/src/Cockpit/panel.cxx or (2)
 fgfs/flightgear/src/Network/generic.cxx, or (3) a scene graph model to
 simgear/simgear/scene/model/SGText.cxx.
