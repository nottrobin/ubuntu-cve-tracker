Description:
 The cgi.rb CGI library for Ruby 1.8 allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via an HTTP request
 with a multipart MIME body that contains an invalid boundary specifier, as
 demonstrated using a specifier that begins with a "-" instead of "--" and
 contains an inconsistent ID.
