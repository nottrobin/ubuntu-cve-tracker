Description:
 status.cgi in Nagios 4.0 before 4.0 beta4 and 3.x before 3.5.1 does not
 properly restrict access to certain users that are a contact for a service,
 which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information
 about hostnames via the servicegroup (1) overview, (2) summary, or (3) grid
 style in status.cgi.  NOTE: this behavior is by design in most 3.x
 versions, but the upstream vendor "decided to change it for Nagios 4" and
 3.5.1.
