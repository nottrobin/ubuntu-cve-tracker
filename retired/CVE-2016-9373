Description:
 In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.7, the DCERPC dissector could
 crash with a use-after-free, triggered by network traffic or a capture
 file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dcerpc-nt.c and
 epan/dissectors/packet-dcerpc-spoolss.c by using the wmem file scope for
 private strings.
