Description:
 The Reader View implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 42.0 has an
 improper whitelist, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass
 the Content Security Policy (CSP) protection mechanism and conduct
 cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors involving SVG animations and
 the about:reader URL.
