Description:
 Argument injection vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer, when
 running on systems with Firefox installed and certain URIs registered,
 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-browser scripting attacks and
 execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a (1) FirefoxURL or
 (2) FirefoxHTML URI, which are inserted into the command line that is
 created when invoking firefox.exe.  NOTE: it has been debated as to whether
 the issue is in Internet Explorer or Firefox. As of 20070711, it is CVE's
 opinion that IE appears to be failing to properly delimit the URL argument
 when invoking Firefox, and this issue could arise with other protocol
 handlers in IE as well. However, Mozilla has stated that it will address
 the issue with a "defense in depth" fix that will "prevent IE from sending
 Firefox malicious data."
