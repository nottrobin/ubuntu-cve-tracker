Description:
 While handling a particular type of malformed packet BIND erroneously
 selects a SERVFAIL rcode instead of a FORMERR rcode. If the receiving view
 has the SERVFAIL cache feature enabled, this can trigger an assertion
 failure in badcache.c when the request doesn't contain all of the expected
 information. Affects BIND 9.10.5-S1 to 9.10.5-S4, 9.10.6-S1, 9.10.6-S2.
