Description:
 A vulnerability in ClamAV versions prior to 0.100.2 could allow an attacker
 to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to
 an error related to the MEW unpacker within the "unmew11()" function
 (libclamav/mew.c), which can be exploited to trigger an invalid read memory
 access via a specially crafted EXE file.
