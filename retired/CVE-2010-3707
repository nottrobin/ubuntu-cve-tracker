Description:
 plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x
 before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the
 permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace
 the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances
 involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries,
 which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access
 restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
