Description:
 The decompose function in platform/transforms/TransformationMatrix.cpp in
 Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85, does not verify that a
 matrix inversion succeeded, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (uninitialized memory access and application crash) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via a crafted web site.
