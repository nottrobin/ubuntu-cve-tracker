Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in
 functions/plugin.php in SquirrelMail 1.4.6 and earlier, if register_globals
 is enabled and magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the plugins array parameter.  NOTE:
 this issue has been disputed by third parties, who state that Squirrelmail
 provides prominent warnings to the administrator when register_globals is
 enabled.  Since the varieties of administrator negligence are uncountable,
 perhaps this type of issue should not be included in CVE.  However, the
 original developer has posted a security advisory, so there might be
 relevant real-world environments under which this vulnerability is
 applicable.
