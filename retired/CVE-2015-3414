Description:
 SQLite before 3.8.9 does not properly implement the dequoting of
 collation-sequence names, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause
 a denial of service (uninitialized memory access and application crash) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted COLLATE clause, as
 demonstrated by COLLATE"""""""" at the end of a SELECT statement.
