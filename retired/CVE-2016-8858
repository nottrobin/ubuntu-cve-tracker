Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The kex_input_kexinit function in kex.c in OpenSSH 6.x and
 7.x through 7.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (memory consumption) by sending many duplicate KEXINIT requests.  NOTE: a
 third party reports that "OpenSSH upstream does not consider this as a
 security issue."
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> DoS is limited to attacker's connection only, and openssh
 mdeslaur> upstream does not consider this to be a security issue
 mdeslaur> We do not consider this to be a security issue either, marking
 mdeslaur> as ignored
