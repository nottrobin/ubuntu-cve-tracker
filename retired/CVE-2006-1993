Candidate: CVE-2006-1993
References:
Description:
 Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.2, when designMode is enabled, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code
 via certain Javascript that is not properly handled by the
 contentWindow.focus method in an iframe, which causes a reference to a
 deleted controller context object.  NOTE: this was originally claimed to be
 a buffer overflow in (1) js320.dll and (2) xpcom_core.dll, but the vendor
 disputes this claim.
