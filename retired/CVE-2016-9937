Description:
 An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.12.x and 13.13.x before
 13.13.1 and 14.x before 14.2.1. If an SDP offer or answer is received with
 the Opus codec and with the format parameters separated using a space the
 code responsible for parsing will recursively call itself until it crashes.
 This occurs as the code does not properly handle spaces separating the
 parameters. This does NOT require the endpoint to have Opus configured in
 Asterisk. This also does not require the endpoint to be authenticated. If
 guest is enabled for chan_sip or anonymous in chan_pjsip an SDP offer or
 answer is still processed and the crash occurs.
