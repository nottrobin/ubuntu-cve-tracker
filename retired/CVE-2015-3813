Description:
 The fragment_add_work function in epan/reassemble.c in the
 packet-reassembly feature in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.5 does not
 properly determine the defragmentation state in a case of an insufficient
 snapshot length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (memory consumption) via a crafted packet.
