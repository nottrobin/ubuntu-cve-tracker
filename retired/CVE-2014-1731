Description:
 core/html/HTMLSelectElement.cpp in the DOM implementation in Blink, as used
 in Google Chrome before 34.0.1847.131 on Windows and OS X and before
 34.0.1847.132 on Linux, does not properly check renderer state upon a focus
 event, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that leverage "type
 confusion" for SELECT elements.
