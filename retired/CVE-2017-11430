Description:
 OmniAuth OmnitAuth-SAML 1.9.0 and earlier may incorrectly utilize the
 results of XML DOM traversal and canonicalization APIs in such a way that
 an attacker may be able to manipulate the SAML data without invalidating
 the cryptographic signature, allowing the attack to potentially bypass
 authentication to SAML service providers.
