Description:
 SampleTable.cpp in libstagefright in Android before 5.1.1 LMY48I does not
 properly consider integer promotion, which allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (integer overflow and
 memory corruption) via crafted atoms in MP4 data, aka internal bug
 20139950, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-1538. NOTE: this
 vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-7915,
 CVE-2014-7916, and/or CVE-2014-7917.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> as with previous stagefright issues, this issue affects Ubuntu's
  android packages, but not in a way that is exposed to apps.  See
