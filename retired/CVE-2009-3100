Description:
 xscreensaver (aka Gnome-XScreenSaver) in Sun Solaris 9 and 10, OpenSolaris
 snv_109 through snv_122, and X11 6.4.1 on Solaris 8 does not properly
 handle Accessibility support, which allows local users to cause a denial of
 service (system hang) by locking the screen and then attempting to launch
 an Accessibility pop-up window, related to a regression in certain Solaris
 and OpenSolaris patches.
