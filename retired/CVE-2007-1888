Candidate: CVE-2007-1888
References:
 http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-455-1
Description:
 Buffer overflow in the sqlite_decode_binary function in src/encode.c in
 SQLite 2, as used by PHP 4.x through 5.x and other applications, allows
 context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via an empty value of
 the in parameter.  NOTE: some PHP installations use a bundled version of
 sqlite without this vulnerability.  The SQLite developer has argued that
 this issue could be due to a misuse of the sqlite_decode_binary() API.
