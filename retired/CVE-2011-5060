Description:
 The par_mktmpdir function in the PAR module before 1.003 for Perl creates
 temporary files in a directory with a predictable name without verifying
 ownership and permissions of this directory, which allows local users to
 overwrite files when another user extracts a PAR packed program, a
 different vulnerability in a different package than CVE-2011-4114.
