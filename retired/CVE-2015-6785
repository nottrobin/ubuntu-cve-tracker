Description:
 The CSPSource::hostMatches function in
 WebKit/Source/core/frame/csp/CSPSource.cpp in the Content Security Policy
 (CSP) implementation in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73 accepts an x.y
 hostname as a match for a *.x.y pattern, which might allow remote attackers
 to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by
 leveraging a policy that was intended to be specific to subdomains.
