Description:
 curl and libcurl before 7.50.2, when built with NSS and the libnsspem.so
 library is available at runtime, allow remote attackers to hijack the
 authentication of a TLS connection by leveraging reuse of a previously

 certificate has been set, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-5420.
