Description:
 A flaw in systemd v228 in /src/basic/fs-util.c caused world writable suid
 files to be created when using the systemd timers features, allowing local
 attackers to escalate their privileges to root. This is fixed in v229.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> It looks to me like systemd from the stable phone overlay has the
  vulnerable code in src/shared/util.c. However, systemd is not used for pid 1
  on the phone so marking that specific release as low.
