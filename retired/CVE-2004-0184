Description:
 Integer underflow in the isakmp_id_print for TCPDUMP 3.8.1 and earlier
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via an ISAKMP
 packet with an Identification payload with a length that becomes less than
 8 during byte order conversion, which causes an out-of-bounds read, as
 demonstrated by the Striker ISAKMP Protocol Test Suite.
