Description:
 The _gdGetColors function in gd_gd.c in PHP 5.2.11 and 5.3.x before 5.3.1,
 and the GD Graphics Library 2.x, does not properly verify a certain
 colorsTotal structure member, which might allow remote attackers to conduct
 buffer overflow or buffer over-read attacks via a crafted GD file, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2009-3293. NOTE: some of these details are
 obtained from third party information.
