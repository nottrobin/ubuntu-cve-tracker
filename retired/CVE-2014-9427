Description:
 sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in the CGI component in PHP through 5.4.36, 5.5.x
 through 5.5.20, and 5.6.x through 5.6.4, when mmap is used to read a .php
 file, does not properly consider the mapping's length during processing of
 an invalid file that begins with a # character and lacks a newline
 character, which causes an out-of-bounds read and might (1) allow remote
 attackers to obtain sensitive information from php-cgi process memory by
 leveraging the ability to upload a .php file or (2) trigger unexpected code
 execution if a valid PHP script is present in memory locations adjacent to
 the mapping.
