Description:
 The check_rpcsec_auth function in kadmin/server/kadm_rpc_svc.c in kadmind
 in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.11.5, 1.12.x through 1.12.2, and
 1.13.x before 1.13.1 allows remote authenticated users to bypass a kadmin/*
 authorization check and obtain administrative access by leveraging access
 to a two-component principal with an initial "kadmind" substring, as
 demonstrated by a "ka/x" principal.
