Description:
 In LibTIFF 4.0.8, there is a heap-based buffer overflow in the
 t2p_write_pdf function in tools/tiff2pdf.c. This heap overflow could lead
 to different damages. For example, a crafted TIFF document can lead to an
 out-of-bounds read in TIFFCleanup, an invalid free in TIFFClose or
 t2p_free, memory corruption in t2p_readwrite_pdf_image, or a double free in
 t2p_free. Given these possibilities, it probably could cause arbitrary code
 execution.
