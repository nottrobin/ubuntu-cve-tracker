Description:
 OpenStack Image Registry and Delivery Service (Glance) 2014.2 through
 2014.2.2 does not properly remove images, which allows remote authenticated
 users to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by creating a large
 number of images using the task v2 API and then deleting them, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2014-9684.
