Candidate: CVE-2007-3007
References: 
Description:
 PHP 5 before 5.2.3 does not enforce the open_basedir or safe_mode
 restriction in certain cases, which allows context-dependent attackers to
 determine the existence of arbitrary files by checking if the readfile
 function returns a string.  NOTE: this issue might also involve the
 realpath function.
