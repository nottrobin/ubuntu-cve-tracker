Description:
 The error-message functionality in Moodle 1.9.x before 1.9.13, 2.0.x before
 2.0.4, and 2.1.x before 2.1.1 does not ensure that a continuation link
 refers to an http or https URL for the local Moodle instance, which might
 allow attackers to trick users into visiting arbitrary web sites via
 unspecified vectors.
