Description:
 The BN_sqr implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8zd, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0p,
 and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k does not properly calculate the square of a BIGNUM
 value, which might make it easier for remote attackers to defeat
 cryptographic protection mechanisms via unspecified vectors, related to
 crypto/bn/asm/mips.pl, crypto/bn/asm/x86_64-gcc.c, and crypto/bn/bn_asm.c.
