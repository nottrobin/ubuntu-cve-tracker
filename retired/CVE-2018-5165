Description:
 In 32-bit versions of Firefox, the Adobe Flash plugin setting for "Enable
 Adobe Flash protected mode" is unchecked by default even though the Adobe
 Flash sandbox is actually enabled. The displayed state is the reverse of
 the true setting, resulting in user confusion. This could cause users to
 select this setting intending to activate it and inadvertently turn
 protections off. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
