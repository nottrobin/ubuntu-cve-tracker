Description:
 An exploitable use-after-free vulnerability exists in the HTTP server
 implementation of Cesanta Mongoose 6.8. An ordinary HTTP POST request with
 a CGI target can cause a reuse of previously freed pointer potentially
 resulting in remote code execution. An attacker needs to send this HTTP
 request over the network to trigger this vulnerability.
