Description:
 The CPDF_DIBSource::CreateDecoder function in
 core/fpdfapi/fpdf_render/fpdf_render_loadimage.cpp in PDFium, as used in
 Google Chrome before 51.0.2704.63, mishandles decoder-initialization
 failure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted PDF document.
