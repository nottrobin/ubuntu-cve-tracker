Description:
 SUSE openSUSE Factory assigns ownership of the /var/log/cobbler/ directory
 tree to the web-service user account, which might allow local users to gain
 privileges by leveraging access to this account during root filesystem
 operations by the Cobbler daemon.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> looks like cobbler in natty has /var/log/cobbler set to
 mdeslaur> root:root, so we're not affected.
