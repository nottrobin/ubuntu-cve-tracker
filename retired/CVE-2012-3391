Description:
 mod/forum/rsslib.php in Moodle 2.1.x before 2.1.7 and 2.2.x before 2.2.4
 does not properly implement the requirement for posting before reading a
 Q&A forum, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended
 access restrictions by leveraging the student role and reading the RSS feed
 for a forum.
