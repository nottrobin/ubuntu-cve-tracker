Description:
 In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, when mod_session is configured to forward
 its session data to CGI applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a
 remote user may influence their content by using a "Session" header. This
 comes from the "HTTP_SESSION" variable name used by mod_session to forward
 its data to CGIs, since the prefix "HTTP_" is also used by the Apache HTTP
 Server to pass HTTP header fields, per CGI specifications.
