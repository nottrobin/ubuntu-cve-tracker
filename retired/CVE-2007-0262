Description:
 WordPress 2.0.6, and 2.1Alpha 3 (SVN:4662), does not properly verify that
 the m parameter value has the string data type, which allows remote
 attackers to obtain sensitive information via an invalid m[] parameter, as
 demonstrated by obtaining the path, and obtaining certain SQL information
 such as the table prefix.
