Description:
 A mishandled zero case was discovered in opj_j2k_set_cinema_parameters in
 lib/openjp2/j2k.c in OpenJPEG 2.2.0. The vulnerability causes an
 out-of-bounds write, which may lead to remote denial of service (heap-based
 buffer overflow affecting opj_write_bytes_LE in lib/openjp2/cio.c and
 opj_j2k_write_sot in lib/openjp2/j2k.c) or possibly remote code execution.
