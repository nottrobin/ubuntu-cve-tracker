Description:
 A "data:" URL loaded in a new tab did not inherit the Content Security
 Policy (CSP) of the original page, allowing for bypasses of the policy
 including the execution of JavaScript. In prior versions when "data:"
 documents also inherited the context of the original page this would allow
 for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability
 affects Firefox < 57.
