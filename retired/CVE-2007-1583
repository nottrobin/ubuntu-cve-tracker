Description:
 The mb_parse_str function in PHP 4.0.0 through 4.4.6 and 5.0.0 through
 5.2.1 sets the internal register_globals flag and does not disable it in
 certain cases when a script terminates, which allows remote attackers to
 invoke available PHP scripts with register_globals functionality that is
 not detectable by these scripts, as demonstrated by forcing a memory_limit
 violation.
