Description:
 A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol
 in Pidgin. Specially crafted MXIT data sent by the server could potentially
 result in an out-of-bounds write of one byte. A malicious server can send a
 negative content-length in response to a HTTP request triggering the
 vulnerability.
