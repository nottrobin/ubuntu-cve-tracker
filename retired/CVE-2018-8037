Description:
 If an async request was completed by the application at the same time as
 the container triggered the async timeout, a race condition existed that
 could result in a user seeing a response intended for a different user. An
 additional issue was present in the NIO and NIO2 connectors that did not
 correctly track the closure of the connection when an async request was
 completed by the application and timed out by the container at the same
 time. This could also result in a user seeing a response intended for
 another user. Versions Affected: Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M9 to 9.0.9 and 8.5.5
 to 8.5.31.
