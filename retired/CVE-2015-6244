Description:
 The dissect_zbee_secure function in epan/dissectors/packet-zbee-security.c
 in the ZigBee dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.7 improperly relies
 on length fields contained in packet data, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.
