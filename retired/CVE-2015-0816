Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 37.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.6, and Thunderbird
 before 31.6 do not properly restrict resource: URLs, which makes it easier
 for remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome
 privileges by leveraging the ability to bypass the Same Origin Policy, as
 demonstrated by the resource: URL associated with PDF.js.
