Candidate: CVE-2006-2607
References:
Description:
 do_command.c in Vixie cron (vixie-cron) 4.1 does not check the return code
 of a setuid call, which might allow local users to gain root privileges if
 setuid fails in cases such as PAM failures or resource limits, as
 originally demonstrated by a program that exceeds the process limits as
 defined in /etc/security/limits.conf.
