Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
 JCE). The supported version that is affected is Java SE: 8u212. Difficult
 to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network
 access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of
 this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a partial
 denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE. Note: This vulnerability
 applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java
 Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load
 and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely
 on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited
 by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which
 supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.7 (Availability impacts).
 CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).
Ubuntu-Description:
 Nati Nimni discovered that the Java Cryptography Extension component in
 OpenJDK did not properly perform array bounds checking in some situations. An
 attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.
