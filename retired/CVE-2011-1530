Description:
 The process_tgs_req function in do_tgs_req.c in the Key Distribution Center
 (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.9 through 1.9.2 allows remote
 authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference
 and daemon crash) via a crafted TGS request that triggers an error other
 than the KRB5_KDB_NOENTRY error.
