Description:
 The UnescapeURLWithAdjustmentsImpl implementation in net/base/escape.cc in
 Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85 does not prevent display of Unicode LOCK
 characters in the omnibox, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
 spoof the SSL lock icon by placing one of these characters at the end of a
 URL, as demonstrated by the omnibox in localizations for right-to-left
 languages.
