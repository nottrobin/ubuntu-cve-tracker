Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the _chm_find_in_PMGL function in chm_lib.c
 for chmlib before 0.36, as used in products such as KchmViewer, allows
 user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a CHM file containing
 a long element, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-3318.
