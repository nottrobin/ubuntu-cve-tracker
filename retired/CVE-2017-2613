Description:
 jenkins before versions 2.44, 2.32.2 is vulnerable to a user creation CSRF
 using GET by admins. While this user record was only retained until restart
 in most cases, administrators' web browsers could be manipulated to create
 a large number of user records (SECURITY-406).

 Accessing these URLs now no longer results in a user record getting
 created, Jenkins will respond with 404 Not Found if no such user
 exists. When using the internal Jenkins user database, new users can
 be created via Manage Jenkins » Manage Users.
