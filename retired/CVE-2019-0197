Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.34 to 2.4.38. When
 HTTP/2 was enabled for a http: host or H2Upgrade was enabled for h2 on a
 https: host, an Upgrade request from http/1.1 to http/2 that was not the
 first request on a connection could lead to a misconfiguration and crash.
 Server that never enabled the h2 protocol or that only enabled it for
 https: and did not set "H2Upgrade on" are unaffected by this issue.
