Description:
 The Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier default form control for
 passwords and other secrets, <f:password/>, supports form validation (e.g.
 for API keys). The form validation AJAX requests were sent via GET, which
 could result in secrets being logged to a HTTP access log in non-default
 configurations of Jenkins, and made available to users with access to these
 log files. Form validation for <f:password/> is now always sent via POST,
 which is typically not logged.
