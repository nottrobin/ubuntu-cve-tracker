Description:
 The extensions subsystem in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows
 and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux relies on an IFRAME source URL to
 identify an associated extension, which allows remote attackers to conduct
 extension-bindings injection attacks by leveraging script access to a
 resource that initially has the about:blank URL.
