Description:
 Multiple off-by-one errors in the cURL library (libcurl) 7.11.2 through
 7.15.0 allow local users to trigger a buffer overflow and cause a denial of
 service or bypass PHP security restrictions via certain URLs that (1) are
 malformed in a way that prevents a terminating null byte from being added
 to either a hostname or path buffer, or (2) contain a "?"  separator in the
 hostname portion, which causes a "/" to be prepended to the resulting
 string.
