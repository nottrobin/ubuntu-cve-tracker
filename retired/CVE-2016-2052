Description:
 Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in HarfBuzz before 1.0.6, as used in
 Google Chrome before 48.0.2564.82, allow attackers to cause a denial of
 service or possibly have other impact via crafted data, as demonstrated by
 a buffer over-read resulting from an inverted length check in
 hb-ot-font.cc, a different issue than CVE-2015-8947.
