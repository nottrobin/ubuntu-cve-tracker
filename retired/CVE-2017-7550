Description:
 A flaw was found in the way Ansible (2.3.x before 2.3.3, and 2.4.x before
 2.4.1) passed certain parameters to the jenkins_plugin module. Remote
 attackers could use this flaw to expose sensitive information from a remote
 host's logs. This flaw was fixed by not allowing passwords to be specified
 in the "params" argument, and noting this in the module documentation.
