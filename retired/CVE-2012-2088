Description:
 Integer signedness error in the TIFFReadDirectory function in tif_dirread.c
 in libtiff 3.9.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
 negative tile depth in a tiff image, which triggers an improper conversion
 between signed and unsigned types, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
