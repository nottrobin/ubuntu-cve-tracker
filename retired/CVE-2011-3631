Description:
 Hardlink before 0.1.2 has multiple integer overflows leading to heap-based
 buffer overflows because of the way string lengths concatenation is done in
 the calculation of the required memory space to be used. A remote attacker
 could provide a specially-crafted directory tree and trick the local user
 into consolidating it, leading to hardlink executable crash or potentially
 arbitrary code execution with user privileges.
