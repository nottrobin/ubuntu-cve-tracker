Description:
 An information leak exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol in Pidgin.
 Specially crafted MXIT data sent via the server could potentially result in
 an out-of-bounds read. A malicious user, server, or man-in-the-middle can
 send an invalid size for an avatar which will trigger an out-of-bounds read
 vulnerability. This could result in a denial of service or copy data from
 memory to the file, resulting in an information leak if the avatar is sent
 to another user.
