Description:
 Integer overflow in the Samba daemon (smbd) in Samba 2.x and 3.0.x through
 3.0.9 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a Samba request
 with a large number of security descriptors that triggers a heap-based
 buffer overflow.
