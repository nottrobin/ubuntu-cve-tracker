Description:
 The BEGIN regular expression in the awk script detector in
 magic/Magdir/commands in file before 5.15 uses multiple wildcards with
 unlimited repetitions, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
 denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted ASCII file that triggers
 a large amount of backtracking, as demonstrated via a file with many
 newline characters.
