Description:
 An issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind prior to 2.7.9.4,
 2.8.11.2, and 2.9.6. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or for
 a specific property), the service has the Jodd-db jar (for database access
 for the Jodd framework) in the classpath, and an attacker can provide an
 LDAP service to access, it is possible to make the service execute a
 malicious payload.
