Description:
 zsh before 5.0.7 allows evaluation of the initial values of integer
 variables imported from the environment (instead of treating them as
 literal numbers). That could allow local privilege escalation, under some
 specific and atypical conditions where zsh is being invoked in
 privilege-elevation contexts when the environment has not been properly
 sanitized, such as when zsh is invoked by sudo on systems where "env_reset"
 has been disabled.
