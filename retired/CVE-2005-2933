Description:
 Buffer overflow in the mail_valid_net_parse_work function in mail.c for
 Washington's IMAP Server (UW-IMAP) before imap-2004g allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via a mailbox name containing a single
 double-quote (") character without a closing quote, which causes bytes
 after the double-quote to be copied into a buffer indefinitely.
