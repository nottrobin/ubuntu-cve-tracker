Description:
 It was found that RHSA-2018:2918 did not fully fix CVE-2018-16509. An
 attacker could possibly exploit another variant of the flaw and bypass the
 -dSAFER protection to, for example, execute arbitrary shell commands via a
 specially crafted PostScript document. This only affects ghostscript 9.07
 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.
