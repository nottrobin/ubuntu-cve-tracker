Description:
 Interaction error in the PostgreSQL JDBC driver before 8.2, when used with
 a PostgreSQL server with the "standard_conforming_strings" option enabled,
 such as the default configuration of PostgreSQL 9.1, does not properly
 escape unspecified JDBC statement parameters, which allows remote attackers
 to perform SQL injection attacks.  NOTE: as of 20120330, it was claimed
 that the upstream developer planned to dispute this issue, but an official
 dispute has not been posted as of 20121005.
