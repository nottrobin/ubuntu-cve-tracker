Notes:
 msalvatore> The patch from upstream does not resolve the CVE. Backporting this
             the actual fix for trusty requires invasive changes that will
             change the command line interface. The issues is first fixed in
             version 7.0.0 and the changelog mentions it is backwards
             incompatible.
