Description:
 content/base/src/nsDocument.cpp in Mozilla Firefox before 33.0, Firefox ESR
 31.x before 31.2, and Thunderbird 31.x before 31.2 does not consider
 whether WebRTC video sharing is occurring, which allows remote attackers to
 obtain sensitive information from the local camera in certain IFRAME
 situations by maintaining a session after the user temporarily navigates
 away.
