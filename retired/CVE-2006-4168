Description:
 Integer overflow in the exif_data_load_data_entry function in
 libexif/exif-data.c in Libexif before 0.6.16 allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code via
 an image with many EXIF components, which triggers a heap-based buffer
 overflow.
