Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the IMG_LoadLBM_RW function in IMG_lbm.c in
 SDL_image before 1.2.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted IFF
 ILBM file.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
 information.
