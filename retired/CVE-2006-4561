Description:
 Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 JavaScript in the context of the browser's session with an arbitrary
 intranet web server, by hosting script on an Internet web server that can
 be made inaccessible by the attacker and that has a domain name under the
 attacker's control, which can force the browser to drop DNS pinning and
 perform a new DNS query for the domain name after the script is already
 running.
