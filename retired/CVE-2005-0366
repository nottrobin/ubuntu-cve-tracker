Description:
 The integrity check feature in OpenPGP, when handling a message that was
 encrypted using cipher feedback (CFB) mode, allows remote attackers to
 recover part of the plaintext via a chosen-ciphertext attack when the first
 2 bytes of a message block are known, and an oracle or other mechanism is
 available to determine whether an integrity check failed.
