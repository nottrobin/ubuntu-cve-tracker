Candidate: CVE-2006-5298
References:
 http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-373-1
Description:
 The mutt_adv_mktemp function in the Mutt mail client 1.5.12 and earlier
 does not properly verify that temporary files have been created with
 restricted permissions, which might allow local users to create files with
 weak permissions via a race condition between the mktemp and safe_fopen
 function calls.
