Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Lib/webbrowser.py in Python through 3.6.3 does not validate
 strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment
 variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection
 attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: a software maintainer indicates that
 exploitation is impossible because the code relies on subprocess.Popen and
 the default shell=False setting.
