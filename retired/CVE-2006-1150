Description:
 Buffer overflow in Tenes Empanadas Graciela (TEG) 0.11.1, automatically
 appends an _ (underscore) to the end of duplicate nicknames, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) by
 creating multiple users with long, identical nicknames, which triggers an
 off-by-one error.
