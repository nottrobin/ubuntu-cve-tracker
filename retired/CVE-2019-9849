Description:
 LibreOffice has a 'stealth mode' in which only documents from locations
 deemed 'trusted' are allowed to retrieve remote resources. This mode is not
 the default mode, but can be enabled by users who want to disable
 LibreOffice's ability to include remote resources within a document. A flaw
 existed where bullet graphics were omitted from this protection prior to
 version 6.2.5. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions
 prior to 6.2.5.
