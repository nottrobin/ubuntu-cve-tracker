Candidate: CVE-2005-1061
References:
Description:
 The secure script in LogWatch before 2.6-2 allows attackers to prevent
 LogWatch from detecting malicious activity via certain strings in the
 secure file that are later used as part of a regular expression, which
 causes the parser to crash, aka "logwatch log processing regular expression
 DoS."
