Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the FFmpegVideoDecoder::GetVideoBuffer
 function in media/filters/ffmpeg_video_decoder.cc in Google Chrome before
 35.0.1916.153 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
 possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging VideoFrame data
 structures that are too small for proper interaction with an underlying
 FFmpeg library.
