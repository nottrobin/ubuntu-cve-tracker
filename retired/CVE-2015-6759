Description:
 The shouldTreatAsUniqueOrigin function in
 platform/weborigin/SecurityOrigin.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome
 before 46.0.2490.71, does not ensure that the origin of a LocalStorage
 resource is considered unique, which allows remote attackers to obtain
 sensitive information via vectors involving a blob: URL.
