Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in libtiff before 4.0.3 allow remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a crafted (1) extension
 block in a GIF image or (2) GIF raster image to tools/gif2tiff.c or (3) a
 long filename for a TIFF image to tools/rgb2ycbcr.c.  NOTE: vectors 1 and 3
 are disputed by Red Hat, which states that the input cannot exceed the
 allocated buffer size.
