Description:
 hostapd before 2.10 and wpa_supplicant before 2.10 allow an incorrect
 indication of disconnection in certain situations because source address
 validation is mishandled. This is a denial of service that should have been
 prevented by PMF (aka management frame protection). The attacker must send
 a crafted 802.11 frame from a location that is within the 802.11
 communications range.

 An attacker in radio range of the access point could inject a specially
 constructed unauthenticated IEEE 802.11 frame to the access point to
 cause associated stations to be disconnected and require a reconnection
 to the network.
