Description:
 On Windows systems, the logger run by the Windows updater deletes the file
 "update.log" before it runs in order to write a new log of that name. The
 path to this file is supplied at the command line to the updater and could
 be used in concert with another local exploit to delete a different file
 named "update.log" instead of the one intended. Note: This attack only
 affects Windows operating systems. Other operating systems are not
 affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 55.
