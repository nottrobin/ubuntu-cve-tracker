 https://github.com/dwfault/PoCs/blob/master/libwebm%20ParseVP9SuperFrameIndex%20memory%20corruption/libwebm%20ParseVP9SuperFrameIndex%20OOB%20read.md
Description:
 The function ParseVP9SuperFrameIndex in common/libwebm_util.cc in libwebm
 through 2018-01-30 does not validate the child_frame_length data obtained
 from a .webm file, which allows remote attackers to cause an information
 leak or a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and later
 out-of-bounds write), or possibly have unspecified other impact.
