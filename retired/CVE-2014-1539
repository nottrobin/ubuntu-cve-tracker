Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 30.0 and Thunderbird through 24.6 on OS X do not
 ensure visibility of the cursor after interaction with a Flash object and a
 DIV element, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
 clickjacking attacks via JavaScript code that produces a fake cursor image.
