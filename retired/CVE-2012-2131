Description:
 Multiple integer signedness errors in crypto/buffer/buffer.c in OpenSSL
 0.9.8v allow remote attackers to conduct buffer overflow attacks, and cause
 a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact, via crafted DER data, as demonstrated by an X.509 certificate or an
 RSA public key.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete
 fix for CVE-2012-2110.
