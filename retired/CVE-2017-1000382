Description:
 VIM version 8.0.1187 (and other versions most likely) ignores umask when
 creating a swap file ("[ORIGINAL_FILENAME].swp") resulting in files that
 may be world readable or otherwise accessible in ways not intended by the
 user running the vi binary.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 leosilva> I could reproduce following openwall steps
 leosilva> after apply the patch community put available
 leosilva> and repeat the steps in openwall I still got
 leosilva> the same bug behaviour so not sure if patch fix it waiting any comment from community
 leosilva> I could confirm with upstream the patch debian put available from upstream doesn't fix the issue
 msalvatore> Ignoring this CVE. Bram Moolenar (vim's BDFL) had this to say: 
 msalvatore>    1) The permissions are the same as the original file, and that is exactly how it should be. 
 msalvatore>    2) This is working as intended, Vim does not use umask this way.  Umask is only used by
 msalvatore>       simple commands such as cp, not by long running processes that deal with many files. 
 msalvatore>       Problem is with the user expectations.
