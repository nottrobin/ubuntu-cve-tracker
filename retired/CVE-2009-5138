Description:
 GnuTLS before 2.7.6, when the GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT flag is
 not enabled, treats version 1 X.509 certificates as intermediate CAs, which
 allows remote attackers to bypass intended restrictions by leveraging a
 X.509 V1 certificate from a trusted CA to issue new certificates, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2014-1959.
