Description:
 The client in OpenSSH before 7.2 mishandles failed cookie generation for
 untrusted X11 forwarding and relies on the local X11 server for
 access-control decisions, which allows remote X11 clients to trigger a
 fallback and obtain trusted X11 forwarding privileges by leveraging
 configuration issues on this X11 server, as demonstrated by lack of the
 SECURITY extension on this X11 server.
