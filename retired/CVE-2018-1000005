Description:
 libcurl 7.49.0 to and including 7.57.0 contains an out bounds read in code
 handling HTTP/2 trailers. It was reported
 (https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/2231) that reading an HTTP/2 trailer
 could mess up future trailers since the stored size was one byte less than
 required. The problem is that the code that creates HTTP/1-like headers
 from the HTTP/2 trailer data once appended a string like `:` to the target
 buffer, while this was recently changed to `: ` (a space was added after
 the colon) but the following math wasn't updated correspondingly. When
 accessed, the data is read out of bounds and causes either a crash or that
 the (too large) data gets passed to client write. This could lead to a
 denial-of-service situation or an information disclosure if someone has a
 service that echoes back or uses the trailers for something.
