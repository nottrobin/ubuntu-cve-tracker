Description:
 An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before
 2.1.11, and 2.2.x before 2.2.4. Due to an error in shallow key
 transformation, key and index lookups for
 django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField, and key lookups for
 django.contrib.postgres.fields.HStoreField, were subject to SQL injection.
 This could, for example, be exploited via crafted use of "OR 1=1" in a key
 or index name to return all records, using a suitably crafted dictionary,
 with dictionary expansion, as the **kwargs passed to the QuerySet.filter()
 function.
