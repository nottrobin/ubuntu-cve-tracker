Description:
 The virtual filesystem in ownCloud Server before 6.0.9, 7.0.x before 7.0.7,
 and 8.0.x before 8.0.5 does not consider that NULL is a valid getPath
 return value, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended
 access restrictions and gain access to users files via a sharing link to a
 file with a deleted parent folder.
