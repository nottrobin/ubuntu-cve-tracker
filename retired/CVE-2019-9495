Description:
 The implementations of EAP-PWD in hostapd and wpa_supplicant are vulnerable
 to side-channel attacks as a result of cache access patterns. All versions
 of hostapd and wpa_supplicant with EAP-PWD support are vulnerable. The
 ability to install and execute applications is necessary for a successful
 attack. Memory access patterns are visible in a shared cache. Weak
 passwords may be cracked. Versions of hostapd/wpa_supplicant 2.7 and newer,
 are not vulnerable to the timing attack described in CVE-2019-9494. Both
 hostapd with EAP-pwd support and wpa_supplicant with EAP-pwd support prior
 to and including version 2.7 are affected.
