Description:
 ISC DHCP server 4.2 before 4.2.0-P2, when configured to use failover
 partnerships, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (communications-interrupted state and DHCP client service loss) by
 connecting to a port that is only intended for a failover peer, as
 demonstrated by a Nagios check_tcp process check to TCP port 520.
