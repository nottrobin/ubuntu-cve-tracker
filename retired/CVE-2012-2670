Description:
 manageuser.php in Collabtive before 0.7.6 allows remote authenticated
 users, and possibly unauthenticated attackers, to bypass intended access
 restrictions and upload and execute arbitrary files by uploading an avatar
 file with an accepted Content-Type such as image/jpeg, then accessing it
 via a direct request to the file in files/standard/avatar.
