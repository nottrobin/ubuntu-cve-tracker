Description:
 Untrusted search path vulnerability in opcontrol in OProfile 0.9.1 and
 earlier allows local users to execute arbitrary commands via a modified
 PATH that references malicious (1) which or (2) dirname programs.  NOTE:
 while opcontrol normally is not run setuid, a common configuration suggests
 accessing opcontrol using sudo.  In such a context, this is a
 vulnerability.
