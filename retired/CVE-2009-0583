Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in icc.c in the International Color Consortium
 (ICC) Format library (aka icclib), as used in Ghostscript 8.64 and earlier
 and Argyll Color Management System (CMS) 1.0.3 and earlier, allow
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer
 overflow and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by using
 a device file for a translation request that operates on a crafted image
 file and targets a certain "native color space," related to an ICC profile
 in a (1) PostScript or (2) PDF file with embedded images.
