Description:
 The Device Mapper multipathing driver (aka multipath-tools or
 device-mapper-multipath) 0.4.8, as used in SUSE openSUSE, SUSE Linux
 Enterprise Server (SLES), Fedora, nd possibly other operating systenms,
 uses world-writable permissions for the socket file (aka
 /var/run/multipathd.sock), which allows local users to send arbitrary
 commands to the multipath daemon.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> all versions of multipath-tools adjust the umask of the multipath
  socket. In 9.04 and later this is 1000--set-umask-in-multipathd.patch. In
  other releases the patch is applied inline.
 jdstrand> the upstream patches are different, and can be found here:
