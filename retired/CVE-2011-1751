Description:
 The pciej_write function in hw/acpi_piix4.c in the PIIX4 Power Management
 emulation in qemu-kvm does not check if a device is hotpluggable before
 unplugging the PCI-ISA bridge, which allows privileged guest users to cause
 a denial of service (guest crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by
 sending a crafted value to the 0xae08 (PCI_EJ_BASE) I/O port, which leads
 to a use-after-free related to "active qemu timers."
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> patch requires several other patches to be applied first
 jdstrand> adding apparmor tag since qemu-kvm is typically used with libvirt
  on Ubuntu, and is therefore confined by AppArmor
