Description:
 The CGIHTTPServer module in Python 2.7.5 and 3.3.4 does not properly handle
 URLs in which URL encoding is used for path separators, which allows remote
 attackers to read script source code or conduct directory traversal attacks
 and execute unintended code via a crafted character sequence, as
 demonstrated by a %2f separator.
