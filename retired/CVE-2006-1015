Description:
 Argument injection vulnerability in certain PHP 3.x, 4.x, and 5.x
 applications, when used with sendmail and when accepting remote input for
 the additional_parameters argument to the mail function, allows remote
 attackers to read and create arbitrary files via the sendmail -C and -X
 arguments.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is a class of
 technology-specific vulnerability, instead of a particular instance; if so,
 then this should not be included in CVE.
