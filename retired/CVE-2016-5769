Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in mcrypt.c in the mcrypt extension in PHP
 before 5.5.37, 5.6.x before 5.6.23, and 7.x before 7.0.8 allow remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and
 application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
 length value, related to the (1) mcrypt_generic and (2) mdecrypt_generic
 functions.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> The fix relies upon signed multiplication turning into negative
  numbers. Since this is undefined in C, the fix doesn't feel complete or
  or correct to me.
