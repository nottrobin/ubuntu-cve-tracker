Description:
 Samba from version 4.9.0 and before version 4.9.3 that have AD DC
 configurations watching for bad passwords (to restrict brute forcing of
 passwords) in a window of more than 3 minutes may not watch for bad
 passwords at all. The primary risk from this issue is with regards to
 domains that have been upgraded from Samba 4.8 and earlier. In these cases
 the manual testing done to confirm an organisation's password policies
 apply as expected may not have been re-done after the upgrade.
