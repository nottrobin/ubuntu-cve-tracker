Description:
 Race condition in the Xsession script, as used by X Display Manager (xdm)
 in NetBSD before 20060212, X.Org before 20060225, and Solaris 8 through 10
 before 20061006, causes a user's Xsession errors file to have weak
 permissions before a chmod is performed, which allows local users to read
 Xsession errors files of other users.
