Description:
 Buffer overflow in HAProxy 1.4 through 1.4.22 and 1.5-dev through
 1.5-dev17, when HTTP keep-alive is enabled, using HTTP keywords in TCP
 inspection rules, and running with rewrite rules that appends to requests,
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly
 execute arbitrary code via crafted pipelined HTTP requests that prevent
 request realignment from occurring.
