Description:
 A vulnerability was found in node-tar before version 4.4.2 (excluding
 version 2.2.2). An Arbitrary File Overwrite issue exists when extracting a
 tarball containing a hardlink to a file that already exists on the system,
 in conjunction with a later plain file with the same name as the hardlink.
 This plain file content replaces the existing file content. A patch has
 been applied to node-tar v2.2.2).
