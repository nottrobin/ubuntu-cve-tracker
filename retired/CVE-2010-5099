Description:
 The fileDenyPattern functionality in the PHP file inclusion protection API
 in TYPO3 4.2.x before 4.2.16, 4.3.x before 4.3.9, and 4.4.x before 4.4.5
 does not properly filter file types, which allows remote attackers to
 bypass intended access restrictions and access arbitrary PHP files, as
 demonstrated using path traversal sequences with %00 null bytes and
 CVE-2010-3714 to read the TYPO3 encryption key from localconf.php.
