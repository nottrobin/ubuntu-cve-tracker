Description:
 httplib2 0.7.2, 0.8, and earlier, after an initial connection is made, does
 not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's
 Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which
 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary
 valid certificate.
