Description:
 Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.65 relies on libvpx code that was not built
 with an appropriate --size-limit value, which allows remote attackers to
 trigger a negative value for a size field, and consequently cause a denial
 of service or possibly have unspecified other impact, via a crafted frame
 size in VP9 video data.
