Description:
 gio/gsocketclient.c in GNOME GLib 2.59.2 does not ensure that a parent
 GTask remains alive during the execution of a connection-attempting
 enumeration, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (g_socket_client_connected_callback mishandling and application crash) via
 a crafted web site, as demonstrated by GNOME Web (aka Epiphany).
