Description:
 Heap-based buffer underflow in the modmul function in sshbn.c in PuTTY
 before 0.63 allows remote SSH servers to cause a denial of service (crash)
 and possibly trigger memory corruption or code execution via a crafted DSA
 signature, which is not properly handled when performing certain
 bit-shifting operations during modular multiplication.
