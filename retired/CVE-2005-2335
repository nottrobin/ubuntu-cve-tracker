Description:
 Buffer overflow in the POP3 client in Fetchmail before 6.2.5.2 allows
 remote POP3 servers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via long UIDL responses.  NOTE: a typo in an advisory
 accidentally used the wrong CVE identifier for the Fetchmail issue. This is
 the correct identifier.
