Description:
 The JSON Viewer displays clickable hyperlinks for strings that are
 parseable as URLs, including "javascript:" links. If a JSON file contains
 malicious JavaScript script embedded as "javascript:" links, users may be
 tricked into clicking and running this code in the context of the JSON
 Viewer. This can allow for the theft of cookies and authorization tokens
 which are accessible to that context. This vulnerability affects Firefox <
 60.
