Description:
 The IMAP-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.44.0 does not verify that the
 server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN)
 field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
 spoof IMAP servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted
 certificate from a recognized Certification Authority.
