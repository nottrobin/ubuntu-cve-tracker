Description:
 The library's failure to check if certain message types support a
 particular flag, the HDF5 1.8.16 library will cast the structure to an
 alternative structure and then assign to fields that aren't supported by
 the message type and the library will write outside the bounds of the heap
 buffer. This can lead to code execution under the context of the library.
