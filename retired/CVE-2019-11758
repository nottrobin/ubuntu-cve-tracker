Description:
 Mozilla community member Philipp reported a memory safety bug present in
 Firefox 68 when 360 Total Security was installed. This bug showed evidence
 of memory corruption in the accessibility engine and we presume that with
 enough effort that it could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This
 vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.2, and Firefox ESR <
 68.2.
