Description:
 SquirrelMail 1.4.22 (and other versions before 20170427_0200-SVN) allows
 post-authentication remote code execution via a sendmail.cf file that is
 mishandled in a popen call. It's possible to exploit this vulnerability to
 execute arbitrary shell commands on the remote server. The problem is in
 the Deliver_SendMail.class.php with the initStream function that uses
 escapeshellcmd() to sanitize the sendmail command before executing it. The
 use of escapeshellcmd() is not correct in this case since it doesn't escape
 whitespaces, allowing the injection of arbitrary command parameters. The
 problem is in -f$envelopefrom within the sendmail command line. Hence, if
 the target server uses sendmail and SquirrelMail is configured to use it as
 a command-line program, it's possible to trick sendmail into using an
 attacker-provided configuration file that triggers the execution of an
 arbitrary command. For exploitation, the attacker must upload a sendmail.cf
 file as an email attachment, and inject the sendmail.cf filename with the
 -C option within the "Options > Personal Informations > Email Address"
 setting.
