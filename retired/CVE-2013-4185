Description:
 Vishvananda Ishaya from Nebula reported a denial of service
 vulnerability in Nova's handling of network source security group
 policy updates. By performing a large number of server creation
 operations, the proportion of updates increases quadratically and
 may overwhelm nova-network such that it is no longer able to service
 other requests in a timely fashion. Only setups relying on
 nova-network are affected.
