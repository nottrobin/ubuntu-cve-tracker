Description:
 Node.js: All versions prior to Node.js 6.15.0: Debugger port 5858 listens
 on any interface by default: When the debugger is enabled with `node
 --debug` or `node debug`, it listens to port 5858 on all interfaces by
 default. This may allow remote computers to attach to the debug port and
 evaluate arbitrary JavaScript. The default interface is now localhost. It
 has always been possible to start the debugger on a specific interface,
 such as `node --debug=localhost`. The debugger was removed in Node.js 8 and
 replaced with the inspector, so no versions from 8 and later are
 vulnerable.
