Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE
 (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE:
 8u212, 11.0.3 and 12.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u211. Difficult to exploit
 vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via
 multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful
 attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and
 while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may
 significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this
 vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java
 SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to
 Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start
 applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run
 untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the
 Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by
 using APIs in the specified Component, e.g., through a web service which
 supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.4 (Confidentiality
 impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly restrict privileges
 in certain situations. An  attacker could use this to specially
 construct an untrusted Java application or applet that could escape
 sandbox restrictions.
