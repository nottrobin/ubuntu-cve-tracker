Description:
 radare2 through 3.5.1 mishandles the RParse API, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact, as demonstrated by newstr buffer overflows during
 replace operations. This affects libr/asm/asm.c and libr/parse/parse.c.
