Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  Firefox 1.5.0.7 on Kubuntu Linux allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (crash) via a long URL in an A tag.  NOTE: this
 issue has been disputed by several vendors, who could not reproduce the
 report. In addition, the scope of the impact - system freeze - suggests an
 issue that is not related to Firefox. Due to this impact, CVE concurs with
 the dispute.
