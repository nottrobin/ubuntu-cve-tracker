Description:
 chpst in runit 1.3.3-1 for Debian GNU/Linux, when compiled on little endian
 i386 machines against dietlibc, does not properly handle when multiple
 groups are specified in the -u option, which causes chpst to assign
 permissions for the root group due to inconsistent bit sizes for the gid_t
 type.
