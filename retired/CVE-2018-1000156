Description:
 GNU Patch version 2.7.6 contains an input validation vulnerability when
 processing patch files, specifically the EDITOR_PROGRAM invocation (using
 ed) can result in code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via
 a patch file processed via the patch utility. This is similar to FreeBSD's
 CVE-2015-1418 however although they share a common ancestry the code bases
 have diverged over time.
