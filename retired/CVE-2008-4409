Description:
 libxml2 2.7.0 and 2.7.1 does not properly handle "predefined entities
 definitions" in entities, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause
 a denial of service (memory consumption and application crash), as
 demonstrated by use of xmllint on a certain XML document, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2003-1564 and CVE-2008-3281.
