Description:
 Control characters prepended before "javascript:" URLs pasted in the
 addressbar can cause the leading characters to be ignored and the pasted
 JavaScript to be executed instead of being blocked. This could be used in
 social engineering and self-cross-site-scripting (self-XSS) attacks where
 users are convinced to copy and paste text into the addressbar. This
 vulnerability affects Firefox < 57.
