Description: 
 The WebService (XML-RPC) interface in Bugzilla 2.23.3 through 3.0.0 does not
 enforce permissions for the time-tracking fields of bugs, which allows remote
 attackers to obtain sensitive information via certain XML-RPC requests, as
 demonstrated by the (1) Deadline and (2) Estimated Time fields.
