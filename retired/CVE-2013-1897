Description:
 The do_search function in ldap/servers/slapd/search.c in 389 Directory
 Server 1.2.x before 1.2.11.20 and 1.3.x before 1.3.0.5 does not properly
 restrict access to entries when the nsslapd-allow-anonymous-access
 configuration is set to rootdse and the BASE search scope is used, which
 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information outside of the
 rootDSE via a crafted LDAP search.
