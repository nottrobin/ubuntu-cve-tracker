Description:
 gpgv in GnuPG before 1.4.2.1, when using unattended signature verification,
 returns a 0 exit code in certain cases even when the detached signature
 file does not carry a signature, which could cause programs that use gpgv
 to assume that the signature verification has succeeded.  Note: this also
 occurs when running the equivalent command "gpg --verify".
