Description:
 The (1) ftpd and (2) ksu programs in (a) MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) up to 1.5,
 and 1.4.x before 1.4.4, and (b) Heimdal 0.7.2 and earlier, do not check
 return codes for setuid calls, which might allow local users to gain
 privileges by causing setuid to fail to drop privileges.  NOTE: as of
