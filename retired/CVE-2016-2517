 http://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#April_2016_NTP_4_2_8p7_Security
Description:
 NTP before 4.2.8p7 and 4.3.x before 4.3.92 allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (prevent subsequent authentication) by leveraging
 knowledge of the controlkey or requestkey and sending a crafted packet to
 ntpd, which changes the value of trustedkey, controlkey, or requestkey.
 NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2016-2516 regression.
