Description:
 The theme implementation in Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.4 and 2.1.x before
 2.1.1 triggers duplicate caching of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and
 JavaScript content, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
 restrictions and write to an operating-system temporary directory via
 unspecified vectors.
