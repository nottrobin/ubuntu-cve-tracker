Description:
 PHP 4.x to 4.3.9, and PHP 5.x to 5.0.2, when running in safe mode on a
 multithreaded Unix webserver, allows local users to bypass
 safe_mode_exec_dir restrictions and execute commands outside of the
 intended safe_mode_exec_dir via shell metacharacters in the current
 directory name.  NOTE: this issue was originally REJECTed by its CNA before
 publication, but that decision is in active dispute.  This candidate may
 change significantly in the future as a result of further discussion.
