Description:
 The GetUpdateFile function in misc/update.c in the Updater in VideoLAN VLC
 media player before 2.1.6 performs an incorrect cast operation from a
 64-bit integer to a 32-bit integer, which allows remote attackers to
 conduct buffer overflow attacks and execute arbitrary code via a crafted
 update status file, aka an "integer truncation" vulnerability.
