Candidate: CVE-2005-2088
References:
Description:
 The Apache HTTP server before 1.3.34, and 2.0.x before 2.0.55, when acting
 as an HTTP proxy, allows remote attackers to poison the web cache, bypass
 web application firewall protection, and conduct XSS attacks via an HTTP
 request with both a "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header and a
 Content-Length header, which causes Apache to incorrectly handle and
 forward the body of the request in a way that causes the receiving server
 to process it as a separate HTTP request, aka "HTTP Request Smuggling."
