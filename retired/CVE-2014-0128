Description:
 Squid 3.1 before 3.3.12 and 3.4 before 3.4.4, when SSL-Bump is enabled,
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure)
 via a crafted range request, related to state management.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> Flaw requires building the package with --enable-ssl; this flag is
  not used in Debian nor Ubuntu's builds.
 mdeslaur> However, we should probably fix this anyway as rebuilding
 mdeslaur> the Ubuntu package locally to enable ssl is a common scenario.
