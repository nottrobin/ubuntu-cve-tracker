Description:
 src/configure.in in Vim 5.0 through 7.1, when used for a build with Python
 support, does not ensure that the Makefile-conf temporary file has the
 intended ownership and permissions, which allows local users to execute
 arbitrary code by modifying this file during a time window, or by creating
 it ahead of time with permissions that prevent its modification by
 configure.
