Description:
 A maliciously constructed svn+ssh:// URL would cause Subversion clients
 before 1.8.19, 1.9.x before 1.9.7, and 1.10.0.x through 1.10.0-alpha3 to
 run an arbitrary shell command. Such a URL could be generated by a
 malicious server, by a malicious user committing to a honest server (to
 attack another user of that server's repositories), or by a proxy server.
 The vulnerability affects all clients, including those that use file://,
 http://, and plain (untunneled) svn://.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Joern Schneeweisz discovered that Subversion did not properly handle
 host names in 'svn+ssh://' URLs. A remote attacker could use this
 to construct a subversion repository that when accessed could run
 arbitrary code with the privileges of the user.
