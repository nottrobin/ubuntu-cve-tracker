Description:
 Mozilla Firefox 3.0.13 and earlier, 3.5, 3.6 a1 pre, and 3.7 a1 pre;
 SeaMonkey 1.1.17; and Mozilla 1.7.x and earlier do not properly block data:
 URIs in Refresh headers in HTTP responses, which allows remote attackers to
 conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to (1)
 injecting a Refresh header that contains JavaScript sequences in a
 data:text/html URI or (2) entering a data:text/html URI with JavaScript
 sequences when specifying the content of a Refresh header.  NOTE: in some
 product versions, the JavaScript executes outside of the context of the
 HTTP site.
