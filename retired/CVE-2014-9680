Description:
 sudo before 1.8.12 does not ensure that the TZ environment variable is
 associated with a zoneinfo file, which allows local users to open arbitrary
 files for read access (but not view file contents) by running a program
 within an sudo session, as demonstrated by interfering with terminal
 output, discarding kernel-log messages, or repositioning tape drives.
