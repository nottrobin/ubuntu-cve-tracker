Description:
 The dtls1_reassemble_fragment function in d1_both.c in OpenSSL before
 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does not properly
 validate fragment lengths in DTLS ClientHello messages, which allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (buffer
 overflow and application crash) via a long non-initial fragment.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> code in lucid is different, doesn't look vulnerable as it just
 mdeslaur> discards multiple fragments. See:
