Description:
 Bazaar through 2.7.0, when Subprocess SSH is used, allows remote attackers
 to execute arbitrary commands via a bzr+ssh URL with an initial dash
 character in the hostname, a related issue to CVE-2017-9800,
 CVE-2017-12836, CVE-2017-12976, CVE-2017-16228, CVE-2017-1000116, and
 CVE-2017-1000117.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Adam Collard discovered that Bazaar did not properly handle host names
 in 'bzr+ssh://' URLs. A remote attacker could use this to construct
 a bazaar repository URL that when accessed could run arbitrary code
 with the privileges of the user.
