Description:
 The asm.js implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 38.0 does not properly
 determine heap lengths during identification of cases in which bounds
 checking may be safely skipped, which allows remote attackers to trigger
 out-of-bounds write operations and possibly execute arbitrary code, or
 trigger out-of-bounds read operations and possibly obtain sensitive
 information from process memory, via crafted JavaScript.
