Description:
 The Netrw plugin 125 in netrw.vim in Vim 7.2a.10 allows user-assisted
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in filenames
 used by the execute and system functions within the (1) mz and (2) mc
 commands, as demonstrated by the netrw.v2 and netrw.v3 test cases.  NOTE:
 this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2008-2712.
