Description:
 The get_siz function in libavcodec/jpeg2000dec.c in FFmpeg before 2.1 does
 not prevent attempts to use non-zero image offsets, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG2000 data.
