Description:
 Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs
 present in Firefox ESR 60.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
 corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could
 be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR
 < 60.3 and Thunderbird < 60.3.
