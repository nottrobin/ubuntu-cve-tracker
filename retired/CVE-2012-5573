Description:
 The connection_edge_process_relay_cell function in or/relay.c in Tor before
 0.2.3.25 maintains circuits even if an unexpected SENDME cell arrives,
 which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 consumption or excessive cell reception rate) or bypass intended
 flow-control restrictions via a RELAY_COMMAND_SENDME command.
