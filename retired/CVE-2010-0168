Description:
 The nsDocument::MaybePreLoadImage function in
 content/base/src/nsDocument.cpp in the image-preloading implementation in
 Mozilla Firefox 3.6 before 3.6.2 does not apply scheme restrictions and
 policy restrictions to the image's URL, which might allow remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (application crash or hang) or hijack the
 functionality of the browser's add-ons via a crafted SRC attribute of an
 IMG element, as demonstrated by remote command execution through an ssh:
 URL in a configuration that supports gnome-vfs with a nonstandard
 network.gnomevfs.supported-protocols setting.
