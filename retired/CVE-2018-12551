Description:
 When Eclipse Mosquitto version 1.0 to 1.5.5 (inclusive) is configured to
 use a password file for authentication, any malformed data in the password
 file will be treated as valid. This typically means that the malformed data
 becomes a username and no password. If this occurs, clients can circumvent
 authentication and get access to the broker by using the malformed
 username. In particular, a blank line will be treated as a valid empty
 username. Other security measures are unaffected. Users who have only used
 the mosquitto_passwd utility to create and modify their password files are
 unaffected by this vulnerability.
