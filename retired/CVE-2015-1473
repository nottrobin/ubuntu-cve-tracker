Description:
 The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or
 libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size during a
 risk-management decision for use of the alloca function, which might allow
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation
 violation) or overwrite memory locations beyond the stack boundary via a
 long line containing wide characters that are improperly handled in a
 wscanf call.
