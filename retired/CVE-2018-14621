Description:
 An infinite loop vulnerability was found in libtirpc before version
 1.0.2-rc2. With the port to using poll rather than select, exhaustion of
 file descriptors would cause the server to enter an infinite loop,
 consuming a large amount of CPU time and denying service to other clients
 until restarted.
