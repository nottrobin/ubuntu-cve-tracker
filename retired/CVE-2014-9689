Description:
 content/renderer/device_sensors/device_orientation_event_pump.cc in Google
 Chrome before 41.0.2272.76 does not properly restrict access to high-rate
 gyroscope data, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain speech
 signals from a device's physical environment via a crafted web site that
 listens for ondeviceorientation events, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2015-1231.
