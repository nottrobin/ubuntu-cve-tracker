Description:
 A flaw was discovered in Podman where it incorrectly allows containers when
 created to overwrite existing files in volumes, even if they are mounted as
 read-only. When a user runs a malicious container or a container based on a
 malicious image with an attached volume that is used for the first time, it
 is possible to trigger the flaw and overwrite files in the volume.This
 issue was introduced in version 1.6.0.
