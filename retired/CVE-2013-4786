Description:
 The IPMI 2.0 specification supports RMCP+ Authenticated Key-Exchange
 Protocol (RAKP) authentication, which allows remote attackers to obtain
 password hashes and conduct offline password guessing attacks by obtaining
 the HMAC from a RAKP message 2 response from a BMC.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> protocol problem. Not clear if fixes also need to be addressed in
  freeipmi and openipmi
 jdstrand> per Debian: "Contacted relevant maintainers: Since few to no devices
  do mutual authentication, tools shipped by Debian are generally not affected.
  At best, the tools can print a warning for vulnerable devices."
