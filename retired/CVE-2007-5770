Candidate: CVE-2007-5770
References:
 http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-596-1
Description:
 The (1) Net::ftptls, (2) Net::telnets, (3) Net::imap, (4) Net::pop, and (5)
 Net::smtp libraries in Ruby 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 do not verify that the
 commonName (CN) field in a server certificate matches the domain name in a
 request sent over SSL, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
 intercept SSL transmissions via a man-in-the-middle attack or spoofed web
 site, different components than CVE-2007-5162.
