Description:
 The dissect_frame function in epan/dissectors/packet-frame.c in the frame
 metadissector in Wireshark 1.10.x before 1.10.8 interprets a negative
 integer as a length value even though it was intended to represent an error
 condition, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) via a crafted packet.
