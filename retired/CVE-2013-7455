Description:
 Double free vulnerability in the DefaultICCintents function in cmscnvrt.c
 in liblcms2 in Little CMS 2.x before 2.6 allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code via a malformed ICC profile that triggers an error in the
 default intent handler.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that a double free() could occur when the intent
 handling code in the Little CMS library detected an error. An
 attacker could use this to specially craft a file that caused an
 application using the Little CMS library to crash or possibly
 execute arbitrary code.
