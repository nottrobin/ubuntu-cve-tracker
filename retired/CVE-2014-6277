Description:
 GNU Bash through 4.3 bash43-026 does not properly parse function
 definitions in the values of environment variables, which allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
 (uninitialized memory access, and untrusted-pointer read and write
 operations) via a crafted environment, as demonstrated by vectors involving
 the ForceCommand feature in OpenSSH sshd, the mod_cgi and mod_cgid modules
 in the Apache HTTP Server, scripts executed by unspecified DHCP clients,
 and other situations in which setting the environment occurs across a
 privilege boundary from Bash execution.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
 because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-6271 and CVE-2014-7169.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> this issue is mitigated by Florian Weimer's prefix-suffix patch
 mdeslaur> that is included in https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-2364-1/
 mdeslaur> since bash parser vulnerabilities are now limited to specially
 mdeslaur> named environment variables, and as such are no longer directly
 mdeslaur> exposed to CGI scripts, SSH, etc.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Once an upstream patch is made available, we will release bash
 mdeslaur> updates, but we don't consider this to be a critical issue
 mdeslaur> requiring immediate attention.
