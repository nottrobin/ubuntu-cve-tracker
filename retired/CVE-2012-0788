Description:
 The PDORow implementation in PHP before 5.3.9 does not properly interact
 with the session feature, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (application crash) via a crafted application that uses a PDO
 driver for a fetch and then calls the session_start function, as
 demonstrated by a crash of the Apache HTTP Server.
