Description:
 Sandstorm Cap'n Proto before 0.5.3.1 allows remote crashes related to a
 compiler optimization. A remote attacker can trigger a segfault in a 32-bit
 libcapnp application because Cap'n Proto relies on pointer arithmetic
 calculations that overflow. An example compiler with optimization that
 elides a bounds check in such calculations is Apple LLVM version 8.1.0
 (clang-802.0.41). The attack vector is a crafted far pointer within a
 message.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ratliff> Advisory: "Some bounds checks are elided by Apple's compiler and possibly others, leading to a possible attack especially in 32-bit builds."
 ratliff> Setting status to needs-triage to investigate whether it impacts Ubuntu
