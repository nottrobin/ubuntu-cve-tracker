Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** GLib 2.31.8 and earlier, when the g_str_hash function is
 used, computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash
 collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
 denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application
 that maintains a hash table.  NOTE: this issue may be disputed by the
 vendor; the existence of the g_str_hash function is not a vulnerability in
 the library, because callers of g_hash_table_new and g_hash_table_new_full
 can specify an arbitrary hash function that is appropriate for the
 application.
