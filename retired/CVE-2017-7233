Description:
 Django 1.10 before 1.10.7, 1.9 before 1.9.13, and 1.8 before 1.8.18 relies
 on user input in some cases to redirect the user to an "on success" URL.
 The security check for these redirects (namely
 ``django.utils.http.is_safe_url()``) considered some numeric URLs "safe"
 when they shouldn't be, aka an open redirect vulnerability. Also, if a
 developer relies on ``is_safe_url()`` to provide safe redirect targets and
 puts such a URL into a link, they could suffer from an XSS attack.
