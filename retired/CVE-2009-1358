Description:
 apt-get in apt before 0.7.21 does not check for the correct error code from
 gpgv, which causes apt to treat a repository as valid even when it has been
 signed with a key that has been revoked or expired, which might allow
 remote attackers to trick apt into installing malicious repositories.
