Description:
 The FrameLoader::startLoad function in
 WebKit/Source/core/loader/FrameLoader.cpp in Blink, as used in Google
 Chrome before 51.0.2704.79, does not prevent frame navigations during
 DocumentLoader detach operations, which allows remote attackers to bypass
 the Same Origin Policy via crafted JavaScript code.
