Description:
 A command execution issue was found in Apache SpamAssassin prior to 3.4.3.
 Carefully crafted nefarious Configuration (.cf) files can be configured to
 run system commands similar to CVE-2018-11805. This issue is less stealthy
 and attempts to exploit the issue will throw warnings. Thanks to Damian
 Lukowski at credativ for reporting the issue ethically. With this bug
 unpatched, exploits can be injected in a number of scenarios though doing
 so remotely is difficult. In addition to upgrading to SA 3.4.4, we again
 recommend that users should only use update channels or 3rd party .cf files
 from trusted places.
