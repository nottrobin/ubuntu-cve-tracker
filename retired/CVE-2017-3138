Description:
 named contains a feature which allows operators to issue commands to a
 running server by communicating with the server process over a control
 channel, using a utility program such as rndc. A regression introduced in a
 recent feature change has created a situation under which some versions of
 named can be caused to exit with a REQUIRE assertion failure if they are
 sent a null command string. Affects BIND 9.9.9->9.9.9-P7,
 9.9.10b1->9.9.10rc2, 9.10.4->9.10.4-P7, 9.10.5b1->9.10.5rc2,
 9.11.0->9.11.0-P4, 9.11.1b1->9.11.1rc2, 9.9.9-S1->9.9.9-S9.
