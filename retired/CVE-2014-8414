Description:
 ConfBridge in Asterisk 11.x before 11.14.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.6
 before 11.6-cert8 does not properly handle state changes, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (channel hang and memory
 consumption) by causing transitions to be delayed, which triggers a state
 change from hung up to waiting for media.
