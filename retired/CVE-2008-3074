Description:
 The shellescape function in Vim 7.0 through 7.2, including 7.2a.10, allows
 user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via the "!" (exclamation
 point) shell metacharacter in (1) the filename of a tar archive and
 possibly (2) the filename of the first file in a tar archive, which is not
 properly handled by the VIM TAR plugin (tar.vim) v.10 through v.22, as
 demonstrated by the shellescape, tarplugin.v2, tarplugin, and
 tarplugin.updated test cases.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because
 of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2712. NOTE: this issue has the same root
 cause as CVE-2008-3075.  NOTE: due to the complexity of the associated
 disclosures and the incomplete information related to them, there may be
 inaccuracies in this CVE description and in external mappings to this
 identifier.
