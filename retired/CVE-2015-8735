Description:
 The get_value function in epan/dissectors/packet-btatt.c in the Bluetooth
 Attribute (aka BT ATT) dissector in Wireshark 2.0.x before 2.0.1 uses an
 incorrect integer data type, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (invalid write operation and application crash) via a
 crafted packet.
