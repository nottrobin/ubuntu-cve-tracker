Description:
 The dtls1_listen function in d1_lib.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a does
 not properly isolate the state information of independent data streams,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) via crafted DTLS traffic, as demonstrated by DTLS 1.0 traffic to a
 DTLS 1.2 server.
