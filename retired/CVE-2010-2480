Description:
 Mako before 0.3.4 relies on the cgi.escape function in the Python standard
 library for cross-site scripting (XSS) protection, which makes it easier
 for remote attackers to conduct XSS attacks via vectors involving
 single-quote characters and a JavaScript onLoad event handler for a BODY
 element.
