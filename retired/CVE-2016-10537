Description:
 backbone is a module that adds in structure to a JavaScript heavy
 application through key-value pairs and custom events connecting to your
 RESTful API through JSON There exists a potential Cross Site Scripting
 vulnerability in the `Model#Escape` function of backbone 0.3.3 and earlier,
 if a user is able to supply input. This is due to the regex that's
 replacing things to miss the conversion of things such as `<` to `<`.
