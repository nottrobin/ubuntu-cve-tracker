Candidate: CVE-2007-1741
References: 
Description:
 Multiple race conditions in suexec in Apache HTTP Server (httpd) 2.2.3
 between directory and file validation, and their usage, allow local users
 to gain privileges and execute arbitrary code by renaming directories or
 performing symlink attacks. NOTE: the researcher, who is reliable, claims
 that the vendor disputes the issue because "the attacks described rely on
 an insecure server configuration" in which the user "has write access to
 the document root."
