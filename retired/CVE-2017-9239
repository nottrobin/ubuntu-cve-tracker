Description:
 An issue was discovered in Exiv2 0.26. When the data structure of the
 structure ifd is incorrect, the program assigns pValue_ to 0x0, and the
 value of pValue() is 0x0. TiffImageEntry::doWriteImage will use the value
 of pValue() to cause a segmentation fault. To exploit this vulnerability,
 someone must open a crafted tiff file.
