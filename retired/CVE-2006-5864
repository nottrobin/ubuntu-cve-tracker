Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the ps_gettext function in ps.c for GNU gv
 3.6.2, and possibly earlier versions, allows user-assisted attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via a PostScript (PS) file with certain headers that
 contain long comments, as demonstrated using the (1) DocumentMedia, (2)
 DocumentPaperSizes, and possibly (3) PageMedia and (4) PaperSize headers. 
 NOTE: this issue can be exploited through other products that use gv such
 as evince.
