Description:
 gnutls-cli in GnuTLS before 2.6.6 does not verify the activation and
 expiration times of X.509 certificates, which allows remote attackers to
 successfully present a certificate that is (1) not yet valid or (2) no
 longer valid, related to lack of time checks in the
 _gnutls_x509_verify_certificate function in lib/x509/verify.c in
 libgnutls_x509, as used by (a) Exim, (b) OpenLDAP, and (c) libsoup.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> from Debian: "[lenny] - gnutls26 <no-dsa> (Minor issue, explicitly
  labeled as a test program)"
 jdstrand> from upstream: "We are concerned that changing the semantics of an
  existing function in this way may be seen as backwards incompatible, but we
  believe having a default-secure mode should carry more weight here."
 jdstrand> problem is that while gnutls-cli does report the expiration
  properly, it does not exit with error if the certificate is not active
  or expired. The upstream patches are not backwards compatible and the
  risk of regression in changing the library far outweighs the security
  benefit of applying this patch to adjust the return code for gnutls-bin.
  It is possible to adjust the return code of gnutls-bin, but this would
  require diverging from upstream and causing maintenance problems down the
  road.
