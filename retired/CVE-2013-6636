Description:
 The FrameLoader::notifyIfInitialDocumentAccessed function in
 core/loader/FrameLoader.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
 31.0.1650.63, makes an incorrect check for an empty document during
 presentation of a modal dialog, which allows remote attackers to spoof the
 address bar via vectors involving the document.write method.
