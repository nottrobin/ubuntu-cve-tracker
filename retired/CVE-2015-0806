Description:
 The Off Main Thread Compositing (OMTC) implementation in Mozilla Firefox
 before 37.0 attempts to use memset for a memory region of negative length
 during interaction with the
 mozilla::layers::BufferTextureClient::AllocateForSurface function, which
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
 service (memory corruption) via vectors that trigger rendering of 2D
 graphics content.
