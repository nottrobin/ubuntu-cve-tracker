Description:
 actionpack/lib/action_view/template/resolver.rb in Ruby on Rails 3.0.x
 before 3.0.4, when a case-insensitive filesystem is used, does not properly
 implement filters associated with the list of available templates, which
 allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via an
 action name that uses an unintended case for alphabetic characters.
