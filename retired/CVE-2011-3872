Description:
 Puppet 2.6.x before 2.6.12 and 2.7.x before 2.7.6, and Puppet Enterprise
 (PE) Users 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 before 1.2.4, when signing an agent
 certificate, adds the Puppet master's certdnsnames values to the X.509
 Subject Alternative Name field of the certificate, which allows remote
 attackers to spoof a Puppet master via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack
 against an agent that uses an alternate DNS name for the master, aka
 "AltNames Vulnerability."
