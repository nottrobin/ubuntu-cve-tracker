Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE
 (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE:
 6u201, 7u191, 8u182 and 11; Java SE Embedded: 8u181. Difficult to exploit
 vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via
 multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful
 attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and
 while the vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may
 significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this
 vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to
 some of Java SE, Java SE Embedded accessible data. Note: This vulnerability
 applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java
 Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load
 and run untrusted code (e.g. code that comes from the internet) and rely on
 the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java
 deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code
 (e.g. code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.4
 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not
 properly ensure that manifest elements were signed before use.
 An attacker could possibly use this to specially construct an
 untrusted Java application or applet that could escape sandbox
 restrictions.
