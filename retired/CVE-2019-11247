 https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/80983
Description:
 The Kubernetes kube-apiserver mistakenly allows access to a cluster-scoped
 custom resource if the request is made as if the resource were namespaced.
 Authorizations for the resource accessed in this manner are enforced using
 roles and role bindings within the namespace, meaning that a user with
 access only to a resource in one namespace could create, view update or
 delete the cluster-scoped resource (according to their namespace role
 privileges). Kubernetes affected versions include versions prior to 1.13.9,
 versions prior to 1.14.5, versions prior to 1.15.2, and versions 1.7, 1.8,
 1.9, 1.10, 1.11, 1.12.
