Description:
 Buffer overflow in XBoard 4.2.7 and earlier might allow local users to
 execute arbitrary code via a long -icshost command line argument. NOTE:
 since the program is not setuid and not normally called from remote
 programs, there may not be a typical attack vector for the issue that
 crosses privilege boundaries.  Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.
