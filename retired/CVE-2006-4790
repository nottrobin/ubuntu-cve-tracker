Candidate: CVE-2006-4790
References:
 http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-348-1
Description:
 verify.c in GnuTLS before 1.4.4, when using an RSA key with exponent 3,
 does not properly handle excess data in the digestAlgorithm.parameters
 field when generating a hash, which allows remote attackers to forge a PKCS
 #1 v1.5 signature that is signed by that RSA key and prevents GnuTLS from
 correctly verifying X.509 and other certificates that use PKCS, a variant
 of CVE-2006-4339.
