Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 42.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.4 improperly
 follow the CORS cross-origin request algorithm for the POST method in
 situations involving an unspecified Content-Type header manipulation, which
 allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy by leveraging the
 lack of a preflight-request step.
