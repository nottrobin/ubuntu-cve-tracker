Description:
 LibreOffice has a feature where documents can specify that pre-installed
 scripts can be executed on various document events such as mouse-over, etc.
 LibreOffice is typically also bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle
 vector graphics script, which can be manipulated into executing arbitrary
 python commands. By using the document event feature to trigger LibreLogo
 to execute python contained within a document a malicious document could be
 constructed which would execute arbitrary python commands silently without
 warning. In the fixed versions, LibreLogo cannot be called from a document
 event handler. This issue affects: Document Foundation LibreOffice versions
 prior to 6.2.5.
