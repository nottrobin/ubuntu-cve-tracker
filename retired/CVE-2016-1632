Description:
 The Extensions subsystem in Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.75 does not
 properly maintain own properties, which allows remote attackers to bypass
 intended access restrictions via crafted JavaScript code that triggers an
 incorrect cast, related to extensions/renderer/v8_helpers.h and
 gin/converter.h.
