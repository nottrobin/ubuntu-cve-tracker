Description:
 Mozilla Firefox 3.0.13 and earlier, 3.5, 3.6 a1 pre, and 3.7 a1 pre does
 not properly block data: URIs in Location headers in HTTP responses, which
 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via
 vectors related to (1) injecting a Location header that contains JavaScript
 sequences in a data:text/html URI or (2) entering a data:text/html URI with
 JavaScript sequences when specifying the content of a Location header.
 NOTE: the JavaScript executes outside of the context of the HTTP site.
