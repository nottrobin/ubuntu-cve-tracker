 https://bugs.debian.org/865413
Description:
 In Flatpak before 0.8.7, a third-party app repository could include
 malicious apps that contain files with inappropriate permissions, for
 example setuid or world-writable. The files are deployed with those
 permissions, which would let a local attacker run the setuid executable or
 write to the world-writable location. In the case of the "system helper"
 component, files deployed as part of the app are owned by root, so in the
 worst case they could be setuid root.
