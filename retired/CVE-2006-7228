 Integer overflow in Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library

 code via a regular expression that involves large (1) min, (2) max, or (3)
 duplength values that cause an incorrect length calculation and trigger a
 buffer overflow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-7227.  NOTE: this
 issue was originally subsumed by CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been
