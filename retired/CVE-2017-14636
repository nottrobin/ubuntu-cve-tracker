 https://github.com/pts/sam2p/issues/14
Description:
 Because of an integer overflow in sam2p 0.49.3, a loop executes 0xffffffff
 times, ending with an invalid read of size 1 in the Image::Indexed::sortPal
 function in image.cpp. However, this also causes memory corruption because
 of an attempted write to the invalid d[0xfffffffe] array element.
