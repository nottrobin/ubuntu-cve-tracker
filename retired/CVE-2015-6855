Description:
 hw/ide/core.c in QEMU does not properly restrict the commands accepted by
 an ATAPI device, which allows guest users to cause a denial of service or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via certain IDE commands, as
 demonstrated by a WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX command to an empty drive, which
 triggers a divide-by-zero error and instance crash.
