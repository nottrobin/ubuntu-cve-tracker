Description:
 xscreensaver (aka Gnome-XScreenSaver) in Sun Solaris 10, and OpenSolaris
 snv_109 through snv_122, does not properly handle Trusted Extensions, which
 allows local users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and
 console hang) by locking the screen, related to a regression in certain
 Solaris and OpenSolaris patches.
