Description:
 The XMPP protocol plugin in libpurple in Pidgin before 2.10.8 does not
 properly determine whether the from address in an iq reply is consistent
 with the to address in an iq request, which allows remote attackers to
 spoof iq traffic or cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and
 application crash) via a crafted reply.
