Description:
 Exim supports the use of multiple "-p" command line arguments which are
 malloc()'ed and never free()'ed, used in conjunction with other issues
 allows attackers to cause arbitrary code execution. This affects exim
 version 4.89 and earlier. Please note that at this time upstream has
 released a patch (commit 65e061b76867a9ea7aeeb535341b790b90ae6c21), but it
 is not known if a new point release is available that addresses this issue
 at this time.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that Exim did not properly deallocate memory when
 processing certain command line arguments. A local attacker could use
 this in conjunction with another vulnerability to possibly execute
 arbitrary code and gain administrative privileges.
