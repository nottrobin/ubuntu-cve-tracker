Description:
 mod_lua.c in the mod_lua module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.3.x and 2.4.x
 through 2.4.10 does not support an httpd configuration in which the same
 Lua authorization provider is used with different arguments within
 different contexts, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
 restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging multiple Require
 directives, as demonstrated by a configuration that specifies authorization
 for one group to access a certain directory, and authorization for a second
 group to access a second directory.
