Candidate: CVE-2011-0633

Description:
 The Net::HTTPS module in libwww-perl (LWP) before 6.00, as used in
 WWW::Mechanize, LWP::UserAgent, and other products, when running in
 environments that do not set the If-SSL-Cert-Subject header, does not
 enable full validation of SSL certificates by default, which allows remote
 attackers to spoof servers via man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks involving
 hostnames that are not properly validated.  NOTE: it could be argued that
 this is a design limitation of the Net::HTTPS API, and separate
 implementations should be independently assigned CVE identifiers for not
 working around this limitation. However, because this API was modified
 within LWP, a single CVE identifier has been assigned.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> https support moved to liblwp-protocol-https-perl package in Oneiric
 tyhicks> Mitre description suggests that only CN checking is skipped by
          default, while the Red Hat bugzilla suggests that possibly no cert
          checks are done by default. Testing needed to be sure.
 mdeslaur> hardy's libio-socket-ssl-perl doesn't validate certs at all, so
 mdeslaur> we can't just fix libwww-perl.
 mdeslaur> Not many reverse dependencies in main seem to use https, and
 mdeslaur> introducing this into a stable release may cause disruptions for
 mdeslaur> systems using munin, custom code, or some other packages.
 mdeslaur> We are not going to fix this issue in stable releases.
 mdeslaur> If certificate validation is required, we suggest moving to
 mdeslaur> oneiric or newer, or using a backported libwww-perl package.
