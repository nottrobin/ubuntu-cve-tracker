Description:
 An issue was discovered in Django 2.0 before 2.0.3, 1.11 before 1.11.11,
 and 1.8 before 1.8.19. If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words()
 methods were passed the html=True argument, they were extremely slow to
 evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in
 a regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are used to implement
 the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters, which were
 thus vulnerable.
