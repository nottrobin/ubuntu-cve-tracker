Description:
 Off-by-one error in the __gconv_translit_find function in gconv_trans.c in
 GNU C Library (aka glibc) allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
 denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via vectors related to
 the CHARSET environment variable and gconv transliteration modules.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per researcher (Chris Evans), a path with an even number of
  characters to the gconv/ directory makes his exploit harmless. This happens
  to be true on Ubuntu with multiarch on 12.04 LTS and higher on amd64 and
  i386. Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and armhf on all supported releases has an odd path
  length. There are likely other ways to exploit on Ubuntu.
 jdstrand> eglibc on 14.10 exists but is scheduled to be removed
 jdstrand> the severity was bumped from medium to high once additional research
  was revealed on 2014-08-26 (marked PublicDateAtUSN accordingly). There are no
  known active exploits against Ubuntu as of 2014-08-28, but they will likely
  be available soon.
