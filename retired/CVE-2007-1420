Description:
 MySQL 5.x before 5.0.36 allows local users to cause a denial of service
 (database crash) by performing information_schema table subselects and
 using ORDER BY to sort a single-row result, which prevents certain
 structure elements from being initialized and triggers a NULL dereference
 in the filesort function.
