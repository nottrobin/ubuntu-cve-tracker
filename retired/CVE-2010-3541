Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the Networking component in Oracle Java SE and
 Java for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update 25, 1.4.2_27, and 1.3.1_28 allows
 remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via
 unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the
 October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable
 downstream vendor that this is related to missing validation of request
 headers in the HttpURLConnection class when they are set by applets, which
 allows remote attackers to bypass the intended security policy.
Ubuntu-Description:
  It was discovered that the HttpURLConnection class did not validate
  request headers set by java applets, which could allow an attacker
  to trigger actions otherwise not allowed to HTTP clients.
Notes:
  sbeattie> red hat description: HttpURLConnection did not validate
  request headers set by applets, which could allow remote attackers
  to trigger actions otherwise restricted to HTTP clients.
