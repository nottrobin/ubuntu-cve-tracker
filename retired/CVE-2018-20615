Description:
 An out-of-bounds read issue was discovered in the HTTP/2 protocol decoder
 in HAProxy 1.8.x and 1.9.x through 1.9.0 which can result in a crash. The
 processing of the PRIORITY flag in a HEADERS frame requires 5 extra bytes,
 and while these bytes are skipped, the total frame length was not
 re-checked to make sure they were present in the frame.
