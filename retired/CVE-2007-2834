 Integer overflow in the TIFF parser in OpenOffice.org (OOo) before 2.3; and
 Sun StarOffice 6, 7, and 8 Office Suite (StarSuite); allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via a TIFF file with crafted values of
 unspecified length fields, which triggers allocation of an incorrect amount
 of memory, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow.
