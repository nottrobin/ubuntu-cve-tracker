Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The QMP migrate command in QEMU version 4.0.0 and earlier is
 vulnerable to OS command injection, which allows the remote attacker to
 achieve code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure by
 sending a crafted QMP command to the listening server. Note: This has been
 disputed as a non-issue since QEMU's -qmp interface is meant to be used by
 trusted users. If one is able to access this interface via a tcp socket
 open to the internet, then it is an insecure configuration issue.
