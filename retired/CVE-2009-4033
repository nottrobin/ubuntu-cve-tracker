Description:
 A certain Red Hat patch for acpid 1.0.4 effectively triggers a call to the
 open function with insufficient arguments, which might allow local users to
 leverage weak permissions on /var/log/acpid, and obtain sensitive
 information by reading this file, cause a denial of service by overwriting
 this file, or gain privileges by executing this file.
