Description:
 badges/external.php in Moodle 2.5.x before 2.5.2 does not properly handle
 an object obtained by unserializing a description of an external badge,
 which allows remote attackers to conduct PHP object injection attacks via
 unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by overwriting the value of the userid
 parameter.
