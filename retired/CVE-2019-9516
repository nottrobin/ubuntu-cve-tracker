Description:
 Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to a header leak, potentially
 leading to a denial of service. The attacker sends a stream of headers with
 a 0-length header name and 0-length header value, optionally Huffman
 encoded into 1-byte or greater headers. Some implementations allocate
 memory for these headers and keep the allocation alive until the session
 dies. This can consume excess memory.
