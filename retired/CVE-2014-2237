Description:
 The memcache token backend in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) 2013.1 through
 2.013.1.4, 2013.2 through 2013.2.2, and icehouse before icehouse-3, when
 issuing a trust token with impersonation enabled, does not include this
 token in the trustee's token-index-list, which prevents the token from
 being invalidated by bulk token revocation and allows the trustee to bypass
 intended access restrictions.
