Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  gcc 4.2.0 through 4.3.0 in GNU Compiler Collection, when
 casts are not used, considers the sum of a pointer and an int to be greater
 than or equal to the pointer, which might lead to removal of length testing
 code that was intended as a protection mechanism against integer overflow
 and buffer overflow attacks, and provide no diagnostic message about this
 removal. NOTE: the vendor has determined that this compiler behavior is
 correct according to section 6.5.6 of the C99 standard (aka ISO/IEC
 9899:1999).
