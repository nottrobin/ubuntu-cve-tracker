Description:
 Integer overflow in the "file" program 4.20, when running on 32-bit
 systems, as used in products including The Sleuth Kit, might allow
 user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large file that
 triggers an overflow that bypasses an assert() statement.  NOTE: this issue
 is due to an incorrect patch for CVE-2007-1536.
