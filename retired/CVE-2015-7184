Description:
 The fetch API implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0.2 does not
 restrict access to the HTTP response body in certain situations where user
 credentials are supplied but the CORS cross-origin request algorithm is
 improperly followed, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same
 Origin Policy via a crafted web site.
