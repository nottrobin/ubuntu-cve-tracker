Candidate: CVE-2006-5633
References: 
Description:
 Firefox 1.5.0.7 and 2.0, and Seamonkey 1.1b, allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (crash) by creating a range object using
 createRange, calling selectNode on a DocType node (DOCUMENT_TYPE_NODE),
 then calling createContextualFragment on the range, which triggers a null
 dereference.  NOTE: the original Bugtraq post mentioned that code execution
 was possible, but followup analysis has shown that it is only a null
 dereference.
