Description:
 A mechanism to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections on sites
 that have a "script-src" policy of "'strict-dynamic'". If a target website
 contains an HTML injection flaw an attacker could inject a reference to a
 copy of the "require.js" library that is part of Firefox's Developer Tools,
 and then use a known technique using that library to bypass the CSP
 restrictions on executing injected scripts. This vulnerability affects
 Firefox < 60.
