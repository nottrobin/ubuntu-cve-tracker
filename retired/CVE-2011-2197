 http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/6/8/potential-xss-vulnerability-in-ruby-on-rails-applications
Description:
 The cross-site scripting (XSS) prevention feature in Ruby on Rails 2.x
 before 2.3.12, 3.0.x before 3.0.8, and 3.1.x before 3.1.0.rc2 does not
 properly handle mutation of safe buffers, which makes it easier for remote
 attackers to conduct XSS attacks via crafted strings to an application that
 uses a problematic string method, as demonstrated by the sub method.
