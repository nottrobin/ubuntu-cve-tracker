Description:
 X.Org xdm 1.1.10, 1.1.11, and possibly other versions, when performing
 authentication using certain implementations of the crypt API function that
 can return NULL, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
 pointer dereference and crash) by attempting to log into an account whose
 password field contains invalid characters, as demonstrated using the crypt
 function from glibc 2.17 and later with (1) the "!" character in the salt
 portion of a password field or (2) a password that has been encrypted using
 DES or MD5 in FIPS-140 mode.
