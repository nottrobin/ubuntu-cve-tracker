Description:
 In BIND Supported Preview Edition, an error in the nxdomain-redirect
 feature can occur in versions which support EDNS Client Subnet (ECS)
 features. In those versions which have ECS support, enabling
 nxdomain-redirect is likely to lead to BIND exiting due to assertion
 failure. Versions affected: BIND Supported Preview Edition version
 9.10.5-S1 -> 9.11.5-S5. ONLY BIND Supported Preview Edition releases are
 affected.
