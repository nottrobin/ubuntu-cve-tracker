Description:
 The cdf_check_stream_offset function in cdf.c in file before 5.19, as used
 in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.4.30 and 5.5.x before 5.5.14,
 relies on incorrect sector-size data, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted stream offset
 in a CDF file.
