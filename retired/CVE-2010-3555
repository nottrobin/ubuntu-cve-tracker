Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the Deployment component in Oracle Java SE and
 Java for Business 6 Update 21 allows remote attackers to affect
 confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the
 previous information was obtained from the January 2011 CPU. Oracle has not
 commented on claims from a reliable third party coordinator that the
 ActiveX Plugin does not properly initialize an object field that is used as
 a window handle, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.
