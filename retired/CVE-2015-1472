Description:
 The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or
 libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size during memory
 allocation, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a
 long line containing wide characters that are improperly handled in a
 wscanf call.
