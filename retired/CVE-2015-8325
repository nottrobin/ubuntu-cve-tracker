Description:
 The do_setup_env function in session.c in sshd in OpenSSH through 7.2p2,
 when the UseLogin feature is enabled and PAM is configured to read
 .pam_environment files in user home directories, allows local users to gain
 privileges by triggering a crafted environment for the /bin/login program,
 as demonstrated by an LD_PRELOAD environment variable.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> Ubuntu is not affected in the default configuration since
  UseLogin is disabled in sshd_config
