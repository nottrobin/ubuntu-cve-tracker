Description:
 A size-validation issue was discovered in opj_j2k_write_sot in
 lib/openjp2/j2k.c in OpenJPEG 2.2.0. The vulnerability causes an
 out-of-bounds write, which may lead to remote denial of service (heap-based
 buffer overflow affecting opj_write_bytes_LE in lib/openjp2/cio.c) or
 possibly remote code execution. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of
 an incomplete fix for CVE-2017-14152.
