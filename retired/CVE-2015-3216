Description:
 Race condition in a certain Red Hat patch to the PRNG lock implementation
 in the ssleay_rand_bytes function in OpenSSL, as distributed in
 openssl-1.0.1e-25.el7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 and other
 products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) by establishing many TLS sessions to a multithreaded server, leading
 to use of a negative value for a certain length field.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> The vulnerable code in question was introduced as a distro-patch
  by Red Hat to address FIPS locking issues. Our packages don't share the
  locking fix in question, and upstream fixed the FIPS locking via a different
  method.
