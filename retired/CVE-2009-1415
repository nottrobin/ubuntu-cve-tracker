Description:
 lib/pk-libgcrypt.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS before 2.6.6 does not properly
 handle invalid DSA signatures, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (application crash) and possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a malformed DSA key that triggers a (1) free of an uninitialized
 pointer or (2) double free.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
