Description:
 Buffer overflow in the t2p_write_pdf_string function in tiff2pdf in libtiff
 3.8.2 and earlier allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a TIFF file with a DocumentName tag
 that contains UTF-8 characters, which triggers the overflow when a
 character is sign extended to an integer that produces more digits than
 expected in an sprintf call.
