Description:
 PHP through 7.1.11 enables potential SSRF in applications that accept an
 fsockopen or pfsockopen hostname argument with an expectation that the port
 number is constrained. Because a :port syntax is recognized, fsockopen will
 use the port number that is specified in the hostname argument, instead of
 the port number in the second argument of the function.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> the change in behaviour broke applications relying on
 mdeslaur> undocumented behaviour so was reverted in subsequent releases
 mdeslaur> We will not be fixing this in stable releases. Marking as ignored.
