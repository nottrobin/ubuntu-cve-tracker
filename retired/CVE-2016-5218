Description:
 The extensions API in Google Chrome prior to 55.0.2883.75 for Mac, Windows
 and Linux, and 55.0.2883.84 for Android incorrectly handled navigation
 within PDFs, which allowed a remote attacker to temporarily spoof the
 contents of the Omnibox (URL bar) via a crafted HTML page containing PDF
 data.
