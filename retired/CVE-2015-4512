Description:
 gfx/2d/DataSurfaceHelpers.cpp in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 on Linux
 improperly attempts to use the Cairo library with 32-bit color-depth
 surface creation followed by 16-bit color-depth surface display, which
 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory
 or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) by using a CANVAS element
 to trigger 2D rendering.
