Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 35.0 and SeaMonkey before 2.32 do not consider the
 id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension in deciding whether to trust an OCSP
 responder, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information by sniffing the network during a session in which there was an
 incorrect decision to accept a compromised and revoked certificate.
