Description:
 The ssl3_client_hello function in s3_clnt.c in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a
 does not ensure that the PRNG is seeded before proceeding with a handshake,
 which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
 protection mechanisms by sniffing the network and then conducting a
 brute-force attack.
