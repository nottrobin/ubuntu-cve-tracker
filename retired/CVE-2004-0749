Description:
 The mod_authz_svn module in Subversion 1.0.7 and earlier does not properly
 restrict access to all metadata on unreadable paths, which could allow
 remote attackers to gain sensitive information via (1) svn log -v, (2) svn
 propget, or (3) svn blame, and other commands that follow renames.
