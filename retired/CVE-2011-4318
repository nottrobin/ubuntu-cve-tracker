Description:
 Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname
 is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server
 hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the
 X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL
 servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes:
 jdstrand> SSL proxy connections were added in some Dovecot v1.x versions, but
  but v1.x doesn't support giving hostname as proxy destination, only IP
  address. (per upstream)
