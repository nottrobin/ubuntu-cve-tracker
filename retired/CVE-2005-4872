Description:
 Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 6.2 does not
 properly count the number of named capturing subpatterns, which allows
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a
 regular expression with a large number of named subpatterns, which triggers
 a buffer overflow.  NOTE: this issue was originally subsumed by
 CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.
