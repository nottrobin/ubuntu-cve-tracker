Candidate: CVE-2007-5960
References:
Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.10 and SeaMonkey before 1.1.7 sets the Referer
 header to the window or frame in which script is running, instead of the
 address of the content that initiated the script, which allows remote
 attackers to spoof HTTP Referer headers and bypass Referer-based CSRF
 protection schemes by setting window.location and using a modal alert
 dialog that causes the wrong Referer to be sent.
