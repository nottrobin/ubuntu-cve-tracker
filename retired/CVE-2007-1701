Candidate: CVE-2007-1701
References:
Description:
 PHP 4 before 4.4.5, and PHP 5 before 5.2.1, when register_globals is
 enabled, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via
 deserialization of session data, which overwrites arbitrary global
 variables, as demonstrated by calling session_decode on a string beginning
 with "_SESSION|s:39:".
