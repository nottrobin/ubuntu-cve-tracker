Description:
 The ipt_recent kernel module (ipt_recent.c) in Linux kernel before 2.6.12,
 when running on 64-bit processors such as AMD64, allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (kernel panic) via certain attacks such as SSH
 brute force, which leads to memset calls using a length based on the
 u_int32_t type, acting on an array of unsigned long elements, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2005-2873.
