Description:
 Multiple open redirect vulnerabilities in Moodle through 2.5.9, 2.6.x
 before 2.6.11, 2.7.x before 2.7.8, and 2.8.x before 2.8.6 allow remote
 attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing
 attacks via vectors involving an error page that links to a URL from an
 HTTP Referer header.
