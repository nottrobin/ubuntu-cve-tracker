Description:
 The disconnect method in the Philips USB Webcam (pwc) driver in Linux
 kernel 2.6.x before 2.6.22.6 "relies on user space to close the device,"
 which allows user-assisted local attackers to cause a denial of service
 (USB subsystem hang and CPU consumption in khubd) by not closing the device
 after the disconnect is invoked.  NOTE: this rarely crosses privilege
 boundaries, unless the attacker can convince the victim to unplug the
 affected device.
