Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in inter-color spaces conversion tools in
 libtiff 3.8 through 3.8.2, 3.9, and 4.0 allow context-dependent attackers
 to execute arbitrary code via a TIFF image with large (1) width and (2)
 height values, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow in the (a)
 cvt_whole_image function in tiff2rgba and (b) tiffcvt function in
 rgb2ycbcr.
