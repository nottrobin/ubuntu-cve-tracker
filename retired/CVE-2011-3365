Description:
 The KDE SSL Wrapper (KSSL) API in KDE SC 4.6.0 through 4.7.1, and possibly
 earlier versions, does not use a certain font when rendering certificate
 fields in a security dialog, which allows remote attackers to spoof the
 common name (CN) of a certificate via rich text.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Tim Brown discovered that KSSL in KDE-Libs did not properly perform input
 validation when displaying the common name (CN) for an SSL certificate. An
 attacker could exploit this to spoof the common name which could be used in
 an attack to trick the user into accepting a fraudulent certificate.
