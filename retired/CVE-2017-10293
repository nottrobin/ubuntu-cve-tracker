Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
 Javadoc). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 6u161, 7u151,
 8u144 and 9. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated
 attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Java SE. Successful
 attacks require human interaction from a person other than the attacker and
 while the vulnerability is in Java SE, attacks may significantly impact
 additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
 unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Java SE accessible
 data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE accessible
 data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in
 clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java
 applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
 internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
 does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run
 only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base
 Score 6.1 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).
