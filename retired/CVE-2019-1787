Description:
 A vulnerability in the Portable Document Format (PDF) scanning
 functionality of Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) Software versions 0.101.1 and
 prior could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
 service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to
 a lack of proper data handling mechanisms within the device buffer while
 indexing remaining file data on an affected device. An attacker could
 exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted PDF files to an affected
 device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a heap
 buffer out-of-bounds read condition, resulting in a crash that could result
 in a denial of service condition on an affected device.
