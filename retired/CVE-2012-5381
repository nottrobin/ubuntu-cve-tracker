Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation
 functionality in PHP 5.3.17, when installed in the top-level C:\ directory,
 might allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in the
 C:\PHP directory, which may be added to the PATH system environment
 variable by an administrator, as demonstrated by a Trojan horse
 wlbsctrl.dll file used by the "IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules" system
 service in Windows Vista SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and
 Windows 8 Release Preview.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the
 unsafe PATH is established only by a separate administrative action that is
 not a default part of the PHP installation.
