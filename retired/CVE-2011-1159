Description:
 acpid.c in acpid before 2.0.9 does not properly handle a situation in which
 a process has connected to acpid.socket but is not reading any data, which
 allows local users to cause a denial of service (daemon hang) via a crafted
 application that performs a connect system call but no read system calls.
