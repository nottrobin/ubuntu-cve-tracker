Description:
 ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability
 that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
 service (DoS) condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on an
 affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation
 checking mechanisms when handling Portable Document Format (.pdf) files
 sent to an affected device. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could
 exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted .pdf file to an affected
 device. This action could cause a handle_pdfname (in pdf.c) buffer overflow
 when ClamAV scans the malicious file, allowing the attacker to cause a DoS
 condition or potentially execute arbitrary code.
