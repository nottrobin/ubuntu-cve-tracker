Description:
 The rtp_packetize_xiph_config function in modules/stream_out/rtpfmt.c in
 VideoLAN VLC media player before 2.1.6 uses a stack-allocation approach
 with a size determined by arbitrary input data, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted length value.
