Description:
 modules/m_capab.c in (1) ircd-ratbox before 3.0.8 and (2) Charybdis before
 3.4.2 does not properly support capability negotiation during server
 handshakes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a malformed request.
