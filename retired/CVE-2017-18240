Description:
 The Gentoo app-admin/collectd package before 5.7.2-r1 sets the ownership of
 PID file directory to the collectd account, which might allow local users
 to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this account for PID
 file modification before a root script sends a SIGKILL (when the service is
 stopped).
