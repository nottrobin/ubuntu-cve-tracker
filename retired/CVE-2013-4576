Description:
 GnuPG 1.x before 1.4.16 generates RSA keys using sequences of introductions
 with certain patterns that introduce a side channel, which allows
 physically proximate attackers to extract RSA keys via a chosen-ciphertext
 attack and acoustic cryptanalysis during decryption. NOTE: applications are
 not typically expected to protect themselves from acoustic side-channel
 attacks, since this is arguably the responsibility of the physical device.
 Accordingly, issues of this type would not normally receive a CVE
 identifier. However, for this issue, the developer has specified a security
 policy in which GnuPG should offer side-channel resistance, and
 developer-specified security-policy violations are within the scope of CVE.
