Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  Buffer overflow in the SQLDriverConnect function in
 unixODBC 2.0.10, 2.3.1, and earlier allows local users to cause a denial of
 service (crash) via a long string in the FILEDSN option.  NOTE: this issue
 might not be a vulnerability, since the ability to set this option
 typically implies that the attacker already has legitimate access to cause
 a DoS or execute code, and therefore the issue would not cross privilege
 boundaries. There may be limited attack scenarios if isql command-line
 options are exposed to an attacker, although it seems likely that other,
 more serious issues would also be exposed, and this issue might not cross
 privilege boundaries in that context.
