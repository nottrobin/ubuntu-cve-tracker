Candidate: CVE-2006-5794
References: 
Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in the sshd Privilege Separation Monitor in
 OpenSSH before 4.5 causes weaker verification that authentication has been
 successful, which might allow attackers to bypass authentication. NOTE: as
 of 20061108, it is believed that this issue is only exploitable by
 leveraging vulnerabilities in the unprivileged process, which are not known
 to exist.
