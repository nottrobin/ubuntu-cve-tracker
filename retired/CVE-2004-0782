Description:
 Integer overflow in pixbuf_create_from_xpm (io-xpm.c) in the XPM image
 decoder for gtk+ 2.4.4 (gtk2) and earlier, and gdk-pixbuf before 0.22,
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain n_col and cpp
 values that enable a heap-based buffer overflow.  NOTE: this identifier is
 ONLY for gtk+.  It was incorrectly referenced in an advisory for a
 different issue (CVE-2004-0687).
