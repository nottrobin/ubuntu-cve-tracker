Candidate: CVE-2005-0241
References:
Description:
 The httpProcessReplyHeader function in http.c for Squid 2.5-STABLE7 and
 earlier does not properly set the debug context when it is handling
 "oversized" HTTP reply headers, which might allow remote attackers to
 poison the cache or bypass access controls based on header size.
