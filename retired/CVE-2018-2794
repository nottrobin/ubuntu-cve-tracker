Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, JRockit component of Oracle Java SE
 (subcomponent: Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE:
 6u181, 7u171, 8u162, 10 and JRockit: R28.3.17. Difficult to exploit
 vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with logon to the
 infrastructure where Java SE, JRockit executes to compromise Java SE,
 JRockit. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other
 than the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, JRockit,
 attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of
 this vulnerability can result in takeover of Java SE, JRockit. Note:
 Applies to client and server deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be
 exploited through sandboxed Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java
 applets. It can also be exploited by supplying data to APIs in the
 specified Component without using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or
 sandboxed Java applets, such as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score
 7.7 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
Ubuntu-Description:
 Francesco Palmarini, Marco Squarcina, Mauro Tempesta, and Riccardo
 Focardi discovered that the Security component of OpenJDK did not
 restrict which classes could be used when deserializing keys from
 the JCEKS key stores. An attacker could use this to specially craft
 a JCEKS key store to execute arbitrary code.
Notes:
 sbeattie> Oracle release notes on this issue:
   Enhanced KeyStore Mechanisms
   
   A new security property named jceks.key.serialFilter has been
   introduced. If this filter is configured, the JCEKS KeyStore uses it
   during the deserialization of the encrypted Key object stored inside
   a SecretKeyEntry. If it is not configured or if the filter result is
   UNDECIDED (for example, none of the patterns match), then the filter
   configured by jdk.serialFilter is consulted.
   
   If the system property jceks.key.serialFilter is also supplied, it
   supersedes the security property value defined here.
   
   The filter pattern uses the same format as jdk.serialFilter. The
   default pattern allows java.lang.Enum, java.security.KeyRep,
   java.security.KeyRep$Type, and javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec but
   rejects all the others.
   
   Customers storing a SecretKey that does not serialize to the above
   types must modify the filter to make the key extractable.
