Description:
 Buffer overflow in the open_sty function in mkind.c for makeindex 2.14 in
 teTeX might allow user-assisted remote attackers to overwrite files and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a long filename.  NOTE: other overflows
 exist but might not be exploitable, such as a heap-based overflow in the
 check_idx function.
