Description:
 The SSLClientSocketNSS::Core::OwnAuthCertHandler function in
 net/socket/ssl_client_socket_nss.cc in Google Chrome before 33.0.1750.117
 does not prevent changes to server X.509 certificates during
 renegotiations, which allows remote SSL servers to trigger use of a new
 certificate chain, inconsistent with the user's expectations, by initiating
 a TLS renegotiation.
