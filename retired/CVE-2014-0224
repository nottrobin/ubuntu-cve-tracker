Description:
 OpenSSL before 0.9.8za, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0m, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1h does
 not properly restrict processing of ChangeCipherSpec messages, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger use of a zero-length master key in
 certain OpenSSL-to-OpenSSL communications, and consequently hijack sessions
 or obtain sensitive information, via a crafted TLS handshake, aka the "CCS
 Injection" vulnerability.
