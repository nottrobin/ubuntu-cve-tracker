Description:
 OpenStack Image Registry and Delivery Service (Glance) 2014.2 through
 2014.2.2 does not properly remove images, which allows remote authenticated
 users to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by creating a large
 number of images using the task v2 API and then deleting them before the
 uploads finish, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-1881.
