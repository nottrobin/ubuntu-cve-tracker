Description:
 The (1) template and (2) inline_template functions in the master server in
 Puppet before 2.6.18, 2.7.x before 2.7.21, and 3.1.x before 3.1.1, and
 Puppet Enterprise before 1.2.7 and 2.7.x before 2.7.2 allows remote
 authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a crafted catalog
 request.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> Upstream no longer supports 0.25.x as found in lucid. The code
 mdeslaur> is substantially different, rendering a backport of this
 mdeslaur> security update difficult. Since puppet in Lucid is almost
 mdeslaur> end-of-life, we aren't planning on backporting the security fix
 mdeslaur> to it. For Lucid users, we recommend using puppet
 mdeslaur> 2.7.1-1ubuntu3.8~ubuntu10.04.1 currently in lucid-backports.
