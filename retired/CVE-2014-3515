Description:
 The SPL component in PHP before 5.4.30 and 5.5.x before 5.5.14 incorrectly
 anticipates that certain data structures will have the array data type
 after unserialization, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 code via a crafted string that triggers use of a Hashtable destructor,
 related to "type confusion" issues in (1) ArrayObject and (2)
 SPLObjectStorage.
