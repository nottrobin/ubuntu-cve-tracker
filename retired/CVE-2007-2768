Description:
 OpenSSH, when using OPIE (One-Time Passwords in Everything) for PAM, allows
 remote attackers to determine the existence of certain user accounts, which
 displays a different response if the user account exists and is configured
 to use one-time passwords (OTP), a similar issue to CVE-2007-2243.
