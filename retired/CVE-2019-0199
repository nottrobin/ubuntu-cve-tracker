Description:
 The HTTP/2 implementation in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.14 and 8.5.0 to
 8.5.37 accepted streams with excessive numbers of SETTINGS frames and also
 permitted clients to keep streams open without reading/writing
 request/response data. By keeping streams open for requests that utilised
 the Servlet API's blocking I/O, clients were able to cause server-side
 threads to block eventually leading to thread exhaustion and a DoS.
