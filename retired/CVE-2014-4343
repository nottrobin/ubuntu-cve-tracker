Description:
 Double free vulnerability in the init_ctx_reselect function in the SPNEGO
 initiator in lib/gssapi/spnego/spnego_mech.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5)
 1.10.x through 1.12.x before 1.12.2 allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code
 via network traffic that appears to come from an intended acceptor, but
 specifies a security mechanism different from the one proposed by the
 initiator.
