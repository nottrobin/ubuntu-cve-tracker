Description:
 Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier provides information about
 Jenkins user accounts which is generally available to anyone with
 Overall/Read permissions via the /user/(username)/api remote API. This
 included e.g. Jenkins users' email addresses if the Mailer Plugin is
 installed. The remote API now no longer includes information beyond the
 most basic (user ID and name) unless the user requesting it is a Jenkins
 administrator.
