Description:
 The do_fork function in Linux 2.4.x before 2.4.26, and 2.6.x before 2.6.6,
 does not properly decrement the mm_count counter when an error occurs after
 the mm_struct for a child process has been activated, which triggers a
 memory leak that allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory
 exhaustion) via the clone (CLONE_VM) system call.
