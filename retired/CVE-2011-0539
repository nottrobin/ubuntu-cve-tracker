Description:
 The key_certify function in usr.bin/ssh/key.c in OpenSSH 5.6 and 5.7, when
 generating legacy certificates using the -t command-line option in
 ssh-keygen, does not initialize the nonce field, which might allow remote
 attackers to obtain sensitive stack memory contents or make it easier to
 conduct hash collision attacks.
