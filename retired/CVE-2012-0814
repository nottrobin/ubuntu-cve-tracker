Description:
 The auth_parse_options function in auth-options.c in sshd in OpenSSH before
 5.7 provides debug messages containing authorized_keys command options,
 which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive
 information by reading these messages, as demonstrated by the shared user
 account required by Gitolite.  NOTE: this can cross privilege boundaries
 because a user account may intentionally have no shell or filesystem
 access, and therefore may have no supported way to read an authorized_keys
 file in its own home directory.
