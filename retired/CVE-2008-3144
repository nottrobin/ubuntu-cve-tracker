Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in the PyOS_vsnprintf function in
 Python/mysnprintf.c in Python 2.5.2 and earlier allow context-dependent
 attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or have
 unspecified other impact via crafted input to string formatting operations.
  NOTE: the handling of certain integer values is also affected by related
 integer underflows and an off-by-one error.
