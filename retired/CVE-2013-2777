Description:
 sudo before 1.7.10p5 and 1.8.x before 1.8.6p6, when the tty_tickets option
 is enabled, does not properly validate the controlling terminal device,
 which allows local users with sudo permissions to hijack the authorization
 of another terminal via vectors related to a session without a controlling
 terminal device and connecting to a standard input, output, and error file
 descriptors of another terminal.  NOTE: this is one of three
 closely-related vulnerabilities that were originally assigned
 CVE-2013-1776, but they have been SPLIT because of different affected
 versions.
