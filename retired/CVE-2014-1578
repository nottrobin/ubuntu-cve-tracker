Description:
 The get_tile function in Mozilla Firefox before 33.0, Firefox ESR 31.x
 before 31.2, and Thunderbird 31.x before 31.2 allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and application crash) or
 possibly execute arbitrary code via WebM frames with invalid tile sizes
 that are improperly handled in buffering operations during video playback.
