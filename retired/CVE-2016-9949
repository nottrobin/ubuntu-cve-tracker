Description:
 An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. In apport/ui.py, Apport
 reads the CrashDB field and it then evaluates the field as Python code if
 it begins with a "{". This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 Python code.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Donncha O Cearbhaill discovered that the crash file parser in Apport
 improperly treated the CrashDB field as python code. An attacker could
 use this to convince a user to open a maliciously crafted crash file
 and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of that user.
