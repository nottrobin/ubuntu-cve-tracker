Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Sudo through 1.8.29 allows local users to escalate to root
 if they have write access to file descriptor 3 of the sudo process. This
 occurs because of a race condition between determining a uid, and the
 setresuid and openat system calls. The attacker can write "ALL ALL=(ALL)
 NOPASSWD:ALL" to /proc/#####/fd/3 at a time when Sudo is prompting for a
 password. NOTE: This has been disputed due to the way Linux /proc works. It
 has been argued that writing to /proc/#####/fd/3 would only be viable if
 you had permission to write to /etc/sudoers. Even with write permission to
 /proc/#####/fd/3, it would not help you write to /etc/sudoers.
