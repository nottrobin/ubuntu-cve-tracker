Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in tcptrack before 1.4.2 might allow attackers
 to execute arbitrary code via a long command line argument. NOTE: this is
 only a vulnerability in limited scenarios in which tcptrack is "configured
 as a handler for other applications." This issue might not qualify for
 inclusion in CVE.
