Description:
 QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) built with the Rocker switch emulation support is
 vulnerable to an off-by-one error. It happens while processing transmit
 (tx) descriptors in 'tx_consume' routine, if a descriptor was to have more
 than allowed (ROCKER_TX_FRAGS_MAX=16) fragments. A privileged user inside
 guest could use this flaw to cause memory leakage on the host or crash the
 QEMU process instance resulting in DoS issue.
