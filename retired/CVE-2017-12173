Description:
 It was found that sssd's sysdb_search_user_by_upn_res() function before
 1.16.0 did not sanitize requests when querying its local cache and was
 vulnerable to injection. In a centralized login environment, if a password
 hash was locally cached for a given user, an authenticated attacker could
 use this flaw to retrieve it.
