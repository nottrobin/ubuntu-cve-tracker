Description:
 KMail 1.9.5 and earlier does not properly use the --status-fd argument when
 invoking GnuPG, which prevents KMail from visually distinguishing between
 signed and unsigned portions of OpenPGP messages with multiple components,
 which allows remote attackers to forge the contents of a message without
 detection.
