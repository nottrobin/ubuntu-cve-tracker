Description:
 glibc contains a vulnerability that allows specially crafted
 LD_LIBRARY_PATH values to manipulate the heap/stack, causing them to alias,
 potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution. Please note that
 additional hardening changes have been made to glibc to prevent
 manipulation of stack and heap memory but these issues are not directly
 exploitable, as such they have not been given a CVE. This affects glibc
 2.25 and earlier.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that the GNU C library did not properly handle
 memory when processing environment variables for setuid programs.
 A local attacker could use this in combination with another
 vulnerability to gain administrative privileges.
