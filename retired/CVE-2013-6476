Description: 
 It was found that the OPVPWrapper::loadDriver() function in the pdftoopvp
 filter did not restrict the directory drivers could be loaded from. As the
 driver name can be configured based on a PPD file, processing a PDF in an
 attacker-controlled directory containing a malicious driver could lead to
 arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the "lp" user.
