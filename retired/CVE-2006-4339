Candidate: CVE-2006-4339
References:
 http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-339-1
Description:
 OpenSSL before 0.9.7, 0.9.7 before 0.9.7k, and 0.9.8 before 0.9.8c, when
 using an RSA key with exponent 3, removes PKCS-1 padding before generating
 a hash, which allows remote attackers to forge a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature
 that is signed by that RSA key and prevents OpenSSL from correctly
 verifying X.509 and other certificates that use PKCS #1.
