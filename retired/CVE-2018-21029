Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** systemd 239 through 244 accepts any certificate signed by a
 trusted certificate authority for DNS Over TLS. Server Name Indication
 (SNI) is not sent, and there is no hostname validation with the GnuTLS
 backend. NOTE: This has been disputed by the developer as not a
 vulnerability since hostname validation does not have anything to do with
 this issue (i.e. there is no hostname to be sent).
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> DNS over TLS not enabled by default in Ubuntu.
 mdeslaur> this is only an issue in v243 because strict mode got
 mdeslaur> introduced (DNSOverTLS=yes). Versions earlier than 243 only
 mdeslaur> implemented opportunistic mode which, according to specs,
 mdeslaur> might or not validate the resolver and can also be downgraded.
