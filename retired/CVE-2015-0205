Description:
 The ssl3_get_cert_verify function in s3_srvr.c in OpenSSL 1.0.0 before
 1.0.0p and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1k accepts client authentication with a
 Diffie-Hellman (DH) certificate without requiring a CertificateVerify
 message, which allows remote attackers to obtain access without knowledge
 of a private key via crafted TLS Handshake Protocol traffic to a server
 that recognizes a Certification Authority with DH support.
