Description:
 Interpretation conflict between Microsoft Internet Explorer and DocuWiki
 before 2007-06-26b allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript
 and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks when spellchecking UTF-8
 encoded messages via the spell_utf8test function in lib/exe/spellcheck.php,
 which triggers HTML document identification and script execution by
 Internet Explorer even though the Content-Type header is text/plain.
