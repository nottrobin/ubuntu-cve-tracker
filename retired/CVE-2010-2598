Description:
 LibTIFF in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 3 on x86_64 platforms, as used
 in tiff2rgba, attempts to process image data even when the required
 compression functionality is not configured, which allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service via a crafted TIFF image, related to
 "downsampled OJPEG input."
