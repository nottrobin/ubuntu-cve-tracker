Candidate: CVE-2013-NNN1
PublicDate: 2013-12-16

Description:
 The mysql-5.5 package misses the patches applied previous in Debian's
 mysql-5.1 to drop the database "test" and the permissions that allow anonymous
 access, without a password, from localhost to the "test" database and any
 databases starting with "test_". This update reintroduces these patches for
 the mysql-5.5 package.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Running mysql_secure_installation (generally recommended for
  production environments) will prompt to remove the 'test' database
 jdstrand> Affects new installations of mysql-5.5, not upgrades from mysql-5.1
  and the Debian patch does not remove the 'test' database on upgrades (to
  prevent data loss).
