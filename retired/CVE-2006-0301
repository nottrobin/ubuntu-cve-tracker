 Heap-based buffer overflow in Splash.cc in xpdf, as used in other products
 such as (1) poppler, (2) kdegraphics, (3) gpdf, (4) pdfkit.framework, and
 others, allows attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
 arbitrary code via crafted splash images that produce certain values that
 exceed the width or height of the associated bitmap.
