Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in the BnHDCP::onTransact function in
 media/libmedia/IHDCP.cpp in libstagefright in Android before 5.1.1 LMY48I
 allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted application that
 uses HDCP encryption, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, aka internal
 bug 20222489.
