Description:
 Double free vulnerability in the prepare_error_as function in do_as_req.c
 in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.7
 through 1.9, when the PKINIT feature is enabled, allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code
 via an e_data field containing typed data.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Cameron Meadors discovered that the MIT Kerberos 5 Key Distribution
 Center (KDC) daemon is vulnerable to a double-free condition if
 the Public Key Cryptography for Initial Authentication (PKINIT)
 capability is enabled. This could allow a remote attacker to cause
 a denial of service.
