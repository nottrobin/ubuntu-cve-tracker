Description:
 Integer underflow in the unlzw function in unlzw.c in gzip before 1.4 on
 64-bit platforms, as used in ncompress and probably others, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted archive that uses LZW compression,
 leading to an array index error.
