Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The Zend Engine in PHP before 5.4.16 RC1, and 5.5.0 before
 RC2, does not properly determine whether a parser error occurred, which
 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 consumption and application crash) via a crafted function definition, as
 demonstrated by an attack within a shared web-hosting environment.  NOTE:
 the vendor's http://php.net/security-note.php page says "for critical
 security situations you should be using OS-level security by running
 multiple web servers each as their own user id."
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> PHP interpreter crashes are outside scope of PHP's security model,
  OS-provided controls must be used to separate untrusted users' code.
