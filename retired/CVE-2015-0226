Description:
 Apache WSS4J before 1.6.17 and 2.0.x before 2.0.2 improperly leaks
 information about decryption failures when decrypting an encrypted key or
 message data, which makes it easier for remote attackers to recover the
 plaintext form of a symmetric key via a series of crafted messages. NOTE:
 this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-2487.
