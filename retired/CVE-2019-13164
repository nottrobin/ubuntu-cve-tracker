Description:
 qemu-bridge-helper.c in QEMU 4.0.0 does not ensure that a network interface
 name (obtained from bridge.conf or a --br=bridge option) is limited to the
 IFNAMSIZ size, which can lead to an ACL bypass.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Riccardo Schirone discovered that the QEMU bridge helper did not
 properly validate network interface names. A local attacker could
 possibly use this to bypass ACL restrictions.
Notes:
 sbeattie> qemu-bridge-helper.c does not exist in precise's qemu
