Description:
 An allocation of memory without limits, that could result in the stack
 clashing with another memory region, was discovered in systemd-journald
 when a program with long command line arguments calls syslog. A local
 attacker may use this flaw to crash systemd-journald or escalate his
 privileges. Versions through v240 are vulnerable.
