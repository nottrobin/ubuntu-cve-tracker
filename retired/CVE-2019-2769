Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE
 (subcomponent: Utilities). Supported versions that are affected are Java
 SE: 7u221, 8u212, 11.0.3 and 12.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u211. Easily
 exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network
 access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded.
 Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability
 to cause a partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE, Java SE
 Embedded. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically
 in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java
 applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that
 comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
 vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified
 Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the APIs.
 CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.3 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that in some situations OpenJDK did not properly
 bound the amount of memory allocated during object deserialization. An
 attacker could use this to specially craft an object that, when
 deserialized, would cause a denial of service (excessive memory
 consumption).
