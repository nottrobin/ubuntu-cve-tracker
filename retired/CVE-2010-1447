Description:
 The Safe (aka Safe.pm) module 2.26, and certain earlier versions, for Perl,
 as used in PostgreSQL 7.4 before 7.4.29, 8.0 before 8.0.25, 8.1 before
 8.1.21, 8.2 before 8.2.17, 8.3 before 8.3.11, 8.4 before 8.4.4, and 9.0
 Beta before 9.0 Beta 2, allows context-dependent attackers to bypass
 intended (1) Safe::reval and (2) Safe::rdo access restrictions, and inject
 and execute arbitrary code, via vectors involving subroutine references and
 delayed execution.
