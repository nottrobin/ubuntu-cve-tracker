Description:
 fcronsighup in Fcron 2.0.1, 2.9.4, and possibly earlier versions allows
 local users to bypass access restrictions and load an arbitrary
 configuration file by starting an suid process and pointing the fcronsighup
 configuration file to a /proc entry that is owned by root but modifiable by
 the user, such as /proc/self/cmdline or /proc/self/environ.
