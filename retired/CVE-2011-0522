Description:
 The StripTags function in (1) the USF decoder
 (modules/codec/subtitles/subsdec.c) and (2) the Text decoder
 (modules/codec/subtitles/subsusf.c) in VideoLAN VLC Media Player 1.1 before
 1.1.6-rc allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a subtitle
 with an opening "<" without a closing ">" in an MKV file, which triggers
 heap memory corruption, as demonstrated using
 refined-australia-blu720p-sample.mkv.
