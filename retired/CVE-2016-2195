Description:
 Integer overflow in the PointGFp constructor in Botan before 1.10.11 and
 1.11.x before 1.11.27 allows remote attackers to overwrite memory and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted ECC point, which triggers a
 heap-based buffer overflow.

 The bigint_mul and bigint_sqr functions received the size of the
 output buffer, but only used it to dispatch to a faster algorithm
 in cases where there was sufficient output space to call an unrolled
 multiplication function.

 The result is a heap overflow accessible via ECC point decoding, which
 accepted untrusted inputs. This is likely exploitable for remote code
 execution.
