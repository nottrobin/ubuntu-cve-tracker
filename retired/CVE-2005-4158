Description:
 Sudo before 1.6.8 p12, when the Perl taint flag is off, does not clear the
 (1) PERLLIB, (2) PERL5LIB, and (3) PERL5OPT environment variables, which
 allows limited local users to cause a Perl script to include and execute
 arbitrary library files that have the same name as library files that are
 included by the script.
