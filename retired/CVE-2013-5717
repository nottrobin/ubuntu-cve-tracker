Description:
 The Bluetooth HCI ACL dissector in Wireshark 1.10.x before 1.10.2 does not
 properly maintain a certain free list, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet that is
 not properly handled by the wmem_block_alloc function in
 epan/wmem/wmem_allocator_block.c.
