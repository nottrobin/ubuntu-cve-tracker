Description:
 Subversion 1.4.3 and earlier does not properly implement the "partial
 access" privilege for users who have access to changed paths but not copied
 paths, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive
 information (revision properties) via svn (1) propget, (2) proplist, or (3)
 propedit.
