Description:
 The IAPP dissector (packet-iapp.c) for Ethereal 0.9.1 to 0.10.9 does not
 properly use certain routines for formatting strings, which could leave it
 vulnerable to buffer overflows, as demonstrated using modified length
 values that are not properly handled by the dissect_pdus and pduval_to_str
 functions.
