Description:
 WebKit in Apple iTunes before 9.2 on Windows, and Apple iOS before 4 on the
 iPhone and iPod touch, accesses out-of-bounds memory during the handling of
 tables, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a
 denial of service (application crash) via a crafted HTML document, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2010-1387 and CVE-2010-1763.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> webkit is a fork of khtml from kdelibs. kdelibs5 is farther from
  it, while qt4-x11 attempts to unify khtml and webkit.
 mdeslaur> webkitkde is a wrapper around qt4-x11's webkit.
 mdeslaur> this looks like an ipod specific dupe of CVE-2010-1774.
