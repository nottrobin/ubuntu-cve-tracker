 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to affect availability via
 unknown vectors related to Server Optimizer.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> mysql-cluster-7.0 not supported per Ubuntu Server team
 jdstrand> As of 2012/01/09, Oracle no longer supports MySQL 5.0.
  Unfortunately, because of upstream update and commit policies it is not
  possible to backport patches from later releases. Ubuntu is regrettably
  unable to support MySQL 5.0 and users are encouraged to upgrade to Ubuntu
  10.04 LTS or later.
