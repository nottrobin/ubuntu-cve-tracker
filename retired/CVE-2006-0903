Description:
 MySQL 5.0.18 and earlier allows local users to bypass logging mechanisms
 via SQL queries that contain the NULL character, which are not properly
 handled by the mysql_real_query function.  NOTE: this issue was originally
 reported for the mysql_query function, but the vendor states that since
 mysql_query expects a null character, this is not an issue for mysql_query.
