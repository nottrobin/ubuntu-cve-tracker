Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in certain versions of xpdf after 3.00, as used
 in various products including (a) pdfkit.framework, (b) gpdf, (c)
 pdftohtml, and (d) libextractor, has unknown impact and user-assisted
 attack vectors, possibly involving errors in (1) gmem.c, (2)
 SplashXPathScanner.cc, (3) JBIG2Stream.cc, (4) JPXStream.cc, and/or (5)
 Stream.cc.  NOTE: this description is based on Debian advisory DSA 979,
 which is based on changes that were made after other vulnerabilities such
 as CVE-2006-0301 and CVE-2005-3624 through CVE-2005-3628 were fixed.  Some
 of these newer fixes appear to be security-relevant, although it is not
 clear if they fix specific issues or are defensive in nature.
