Description:
 The TCP Socket API implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 mishandles
 array boundaries that were established with a navigator.mozTCPSocket.open
 method call and send method calls, which allows remote TCP servers to
 obtain sensitive information from process memory by reading packet data, as
 demonstrated by availability of this API in a Firefox OS application.
