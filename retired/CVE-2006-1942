Description:
 Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.2 and possibly other versions before 1.5.0.4,
 Netscape 8.1, 8.0.4, and 7.2, and K-Meleon 0.9.13 allows user-assisted
 remote attackers to open local files via a web page with an IMG element
 containing a SRC attribute with a non-image file:// URL, then tricking the
 user into selecting View Image for the broken image, as demonstrated using
 a .wma file to launch Windows Media Player, or by referencing an "alternate
 web page."
