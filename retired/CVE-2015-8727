Description:
 The dissect_rsvp_common function in epan/dissectors/packet-rsvp.c in the
 RSVP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1
 does not properly maintain request-key data, which allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and application crash) via a
 crafted packet.
