Description:
 mountall.c in mountall before 2.15.2 uses 0666 permissions for the
 root.rules file, which allows local users to gain privileges by modifying
 this file.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Alasdair MacGregor discovered that mountall created a udev rule file
 with world-writable permissions. A local attacker could exploit this
 under certain conditions to cause udev to execute arbitrary commands as
 the root user.
Notes: 
 kees> luckily, udev doesn't use inotify on this directory at boot time, so
 kees> udev needs to be reloaded before this is really ugly.
