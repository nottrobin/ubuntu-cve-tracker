 https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/83253
Description:
 Improper input validation in the Kubernetes API server in versions
 v1.0-1.12 and versions prior to v1.13.12, v1.14.8, v1.15.5, and v1.16.2
 allows authorized users to send malicious YAML or JSON payloads, causing
 the API server to consume excessive CPU or memory, potentially crashing and
 becoming unavailable. Prior to v1.14.0, default RBAC policy authorized
 anonymous users to submit requests that could trigger this vulnerability.
 Clusters upgraded from a version prior to v1.14.0 keep the more permissive
 policy by default for backwards compatibility.
