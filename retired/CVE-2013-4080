Description:
 The dissect_r3_upstreamcommand_queryconfig function in
 epan/dissectors/packet-assa_r3.c in the Assa Abloy R3 dissector in
 Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.8 does not properly handle a zero-length item,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop,
 and CPU and memory consumption) via a crafted packet.
