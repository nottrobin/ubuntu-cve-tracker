Description:
 WebKit/Source/bindings/modules/v8/V8BindingForModules.cpp in Blink, as used
 in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.113, does not properly consider getter
 side effects during array key conversion, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via crafted Indexed Database (aka IndexedDB) API calls.
