Description:
 ClamAV AntiVirus software versions 0.99.2 and prior contain a vulnerability
 that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of
 service (DoS) condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on an
 affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation
 checking mechanisms in mew packet files sent to an affected device. A
 successful exploit could cause a heap-based buffer over-read condition in
 mew.c when ClamAV scans the malicious file, allowing the attacker to cause
 a DoS condition or potentially execute arbitrary code on the affected
 device.
