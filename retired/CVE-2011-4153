Description:
 PHP 5.3.8 does not always check the return value of the zend_strndup
 function, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via crafted input to an
 application that performs strndup operations on untrusted string data, as
 demonstrated by the define function in zend_builtin_functions.c, and
 unspecified functions in ext/soap/php_sdl.c, ext/standard/syslog.c,
 ext/standard/browscap.c, ext/oci8/oci8.c, ext/com_dotnet/com_typeinfo.c,
 and main/php_open_temporary_file.c.
