Description:
 In libavformat/mxfdec.c in FFmpeg 3.3.3, a DoS in
 mxf_read_index_entry_array() due to lack of an EOF (End of File) check
 might cause huge CPU consumption. When a crafted MXF file, which claims a
 large "nb_index_entries" field in the header but does not contain
 sufficient backing data, is provided, the loop would consume huge CPU
 resources, since there is no EOF check inside the loop. Moreover, this big
 loop can be invoked multiple times if there is more than one applicable
 data segment in the crafted MXF file.
