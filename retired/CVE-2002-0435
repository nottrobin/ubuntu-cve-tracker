Description: 
 Race condition in the recursive (1) directory deletion and (2)
 directory move in GNU File Utilities (fileutils) 4.1 and earlier allows
 local users to delete directories as the user running fileutils by
 moving a low-level directory to a higher level as it is being deleted,
 which causes fileutils to chdir to a ".." directory that is higher than
 expected, possibly up to the root file system.
