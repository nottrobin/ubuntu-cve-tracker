Description:
 In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 releases 2.4.17 to 2.4.38, with MPM event, worker
 or prefork, code executing in less-privileged child processes or threads
 (including scripts executed by an in-process scripting interpreter) could
 execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the parent process (usually
 root) by manipulating the scoreboard. Non-Unix systems are not affected.
