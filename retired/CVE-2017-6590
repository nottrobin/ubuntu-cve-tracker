Description:
 An issue was discovered in network-manager-applet (aka
 network-manager-gnome) in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS, 16.04 LTS, and
 16.10. A local attacker could use this issue at the default Ubuntu login
 screen to access local files and execute arbitrary commands as the lightdm
 user. The exploitation requires physical access to the locked computer and
 the Wi-Fi must be turned on. An access point that lets you use a
 certificate to login is required as well, but it's easy to create one.
 Then, it's possible to open a nautilus window and browse directories. One
 also can open some applications such as Firefox, which is useful for
 downloading malicious binaries.
