Description:
 gnome-screensaver 2.28.x before 2.28.3 does not properly synchronize the
 state of screen locking and the unlock dialog in situations involving a
 change to the number of monitors, which allows physically proximate
 attackers to bypass screen locking and access an unattended workstation by
 connecting and disconnecting monitors multiple times, a related issue to
 CVE-2010-0414.
