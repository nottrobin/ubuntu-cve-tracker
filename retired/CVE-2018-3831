Description:
 Elasticsearch Alerting and Monitoring in versions before 6.4.1 or 5.6.12
 have an information disclosure issue when secrets are configured via the
 API. The Elasticsearch _cluster/settings API, when queried, could leak
 sensitive configuration information such as passwords, tokens, or
 usernames. This could allow an authenticated Elasticsearch user to
 improperly view these details.
