Description:
 lib/ssluse.c in cURL and libcurl 7.4 through 7.19.5, when OpenSSL is used,
 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the subject's
 Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted
 certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue
 to CVE-2009-2408.
