Description:
 A Blob URL can violate origin attribute segregation, allowing it to be
 accessed from a private browsing tab and for data to be passed between the
 private browsing tab and a normal tab. This could allow for the leaking of
 private information specific to the private browsing context. This issue is
 mitigated by the requirement that the user enter the Blob URL manually in
 order for the access violation to occur. This vulnerability affects Firefox
 < 58.
