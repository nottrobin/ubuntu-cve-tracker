Description:
 Postfix before 2.3.15, 2.4 before 2.4.8, 2.5 before 2.5.4, and 2.6 before
 2.6-20080814, when the operating system supports hard links to symlinks,
 allows local users to append e-mail messages to a file to which a
 root-owned symlink points, by creating a hard link to this symlink and then
 sending a message.  NOTE: this can be leveraged to gain privileges if there
 is a symlink to an init script.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> requires postfix as delivery agent, no root alias, no mail delivered
  to root, and the 'mail' account (or an application in the 'mail' group) to
  be compromised
