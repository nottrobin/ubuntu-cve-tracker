Description:
 libsvn_ra_svn in Subversion 1.0.4 trusts the length field of (1) svn://,
 (2) svn+ssh://, and (3) other svn protocol URL strings, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) and possibly
 execute arbitrary code via an integer overflow that leads to a heap-based
 buffer overflow.
