Description:
 An issue was discovered in Apport before 2.20.4. There is a path traversal
 issue in the Apport crash file "Package" and "SourcePackage" fields. These
 fields are used to build a path to the package specific hook files in the
 /usr/share/apport/package-hooks/ directory. An attacker can exploit this
 path traversal to execute arbitrary Python files from the local system.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Donncha O Cearbhaill discovered that Apport did not properly sanitize
 the Package and SourcePackage fields in crash files before processing
 package specific hooks. An attacker could use this to convince a
 user to open a maliciously crafted crash file and execute arbitrary
 code with the privileges of that user.
