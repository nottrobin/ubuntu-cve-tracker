Description:
 The auth_gssapi_unwrap_data function in lib/rpc/auth_gssapi_misc.c in MIT
 Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.11.5, 1.12.x through 1.12.2, and 1.13.x
 before 1.13.1 does not properly handle partial XDR deserialization, which
 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service
 (use-after-free and double free, and daemon crash) or possibly execute
 arbitrary code via malformed XDR data, as demonstrated by data sent to
 kadmind.
