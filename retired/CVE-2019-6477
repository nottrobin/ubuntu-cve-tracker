Description:
 With pipelining enabled each incoming query on a TCP connection requires a
 similar resource allocation to a query received via UDP or via TCP without
 pipelining enabled. A client using a TCP-pipelined connection to a server
 could consume more resources than the server has been provisioned to
 handle. When a TCP connection with a large number of pipelined queries is
 closed, the load on the server releasing these multiple resources can cause
 it to become unresponsive, even for queries that can be answered
 authoritatively or from cache. (This is most likely to be perceived as an
 intermittent server problem).
