Description:
 An integer underflow issue exists in ntfs-3g 2017.3.23. A local attacker
 could potentially exploit this by running /bin/ntfs-3g with specially
 crafted arguments from a specially crafted directory to cause a heap buffer
 overflow, resulting in a crash or the ability to execute arbitrary code. In
 installations where /bin/ntfs-3g is a setuid-root binary, this could lead
 to a local escalation of privileges.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 chrisccoulson> This bug only has security implications when ntfs-3g is
  installed as setuid-root. It's ignored in Ubuntu releases prior to
  xenial, as it isn't installed as setuid-root in these releases.
