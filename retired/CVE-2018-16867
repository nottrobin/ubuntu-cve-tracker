Description:
 A flaw was found in qemu Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) before version
 3.1.0. A path traversal in the in usb_mtp_write_data function in
 hw/usb/dev-mtp.c due to an improper filename sanitization. When the guest
 device is mounted in read-write mode, this allows to read/write arbitrary
 files which may lead do DoS scenario OR possibly lead to code execution on
 the host.
