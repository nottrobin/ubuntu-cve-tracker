Description:
 The default IPSec ifup script in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 through 5
 configures racoon to use aggressive IKE mode instead of main IKE mode,
 which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute force attacks
 by sniffing an unencrypted preshared key (PSK) hash.

Notes:

   has in its commented out section 'exchange_mode main,aggressive'
