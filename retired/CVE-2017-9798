Description:
 Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process
 memory if the Limit directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or if
 httpd.conf has certain misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. This affects
 the Apache HTTP Server through 2.2.34 and 2.4.x through 2.4.27. The
 attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS HTTP request when attempting to
 read secret data. This is a use-after-free issue and thus secret data is
 not always sent, and the specific data depends on many factors including
 configuration. Exploitation with .htaccess can be blocked with a patch to
 the ap_limit_section function in server/core.c.
