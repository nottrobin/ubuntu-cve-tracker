Description:
 The (1) roaming_read and (2) roaming_write functions in roaming_common.c in
 the client in OpenSSH 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x before 7.1p2, when certain proxy
 and forward options are enabled, do not properly maintain connection file
 descriptors, which allows remote servers to cause a denial of service
 (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact by
 requesting many forwardings.
