Description:
 A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of the MXIT protocol
 in Pidgin. Specially crafted MXIT data sent from the server could
 potentially result in arbitrary code execution. A malicious server or an
 attacker who intercepts the network traffic can send an invalid size for a
 packet which will trigger a buffer overflow.
