Description:
 In Xen 4.10, new infrastructure was introduced as part of an overhaul to
 how MSR emulation happens for guests. Unfortunately, one tracking structure
 isn't freed when a vcpu is destroyed. This allows guest OS administrators
 to cause a denial of service (host OS memory consumption) by rebooting many
 times.
