Description:
 The sqlite3VdbeExec function in vdbe.c in SQLite before 3.8.9 does not
 properly implement comparison operators, which allows context-dependent
 attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free operation) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via a crafted CHECK clause, as demonstrated
 by CHECK(0&O>O) in a CREATE TABLE statement.
