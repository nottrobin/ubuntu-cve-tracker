Description:
 In NSA Ghidra through 9.0.4, path traversal can occur in RestoreTask.java
 (from the package ghidra.app.plugin.core.archive) via an archive with an
 executable file that has an initial ../ in its filename. This allows
 attackers to overwrite arbitrary files in scenarios where an intermediate
 analysis result is archived for sharing with other persons. To achieve
 arbitrary code execution, one approach is to overwrite some critical Ghidra
 modules, e.g., the decompile module.
