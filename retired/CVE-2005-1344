Description:
 Buffer overflow in htdigest in Apache 2.0.52 may allow attackers to execute
 arbitrary code via a long realm argument.  NOTE: since htdigest is normally
 only locally accessible and not setuid or setgid, there are few attack
 vectors which would lead to an escalation of privileges, unless htdigest is
 executed from a CGI program.  Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.
