Description:
 The cloudformation-compatible API in OpenStack Orchestration API (Heat)
 before Havana 2013.2.1 and Icehouse before icehouse-2 does not properly
 enforce policy rules, which allows local in-instance users to bypass
 intended access restrictions and (1) create a stack via the CreateStack
 method or (2) update a stack via the UpdateStack method.
