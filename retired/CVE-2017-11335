Description:
 There is a heap based buffer overflow in tools/tiff2pdf.c of LibTIFF 4.0.8
 via a PlanarConfig=Contig image, which causes a more than one hundred bytes
 out-of-bounds write (related to the ZIPDecode function in tif_zip.c). A
 crafted input may lead to a remote denial of service attack or an arbitrary
 code execution attack.
