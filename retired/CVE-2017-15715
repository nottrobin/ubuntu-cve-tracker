Description:
 In Apache httpd 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, the expression specified in <FilesMatch>
 could match '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather than
 matching only the end of the filename. This could be exploited in
 environments where uploads of some files are are externally blocked, but
 only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.
