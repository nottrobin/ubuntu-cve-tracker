Description:
 The add_job function in scheduler/ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS before 2.0.3
 performs incorrect free operations for multiple-value
 job-originating-host-name attributes, which allows remote attackers to
 trigger data corruption for reference-counted strings via a crafted (1)
 IPP_CREATE_JOB or (2) IPP_PRINT_JOB request, as demonstrated by replacing
 the configuration file and consequently executing arbitrary code.
