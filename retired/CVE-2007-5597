Description:
 The hook_comments API in Drupal 4.7.x before 4.7.8 and 5.x before 5.3 does
 not pass publication status, which might allow attackers to bypass access
 restrictions and trigger e-mail with unpublished comments from some
 modules, as demonstrated by (1) Organic groups and (2) Subscriptions.
