Candidate: CVE-2006-7051
References: 
Description:
 The sys_timer_create function in posix-timers.c for Linux kernel 2.6.x
 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) and
 possibly bypass memory limits or cause other processes to be killed by
 creating a large number of posix timers, which are allocated in kernel
 memory but are not treated as part of the process' memory.

Notes: 
 kees> no upstream fix, should be managed with ulimit instead
