Description:
 Off-by-one buffer overflow in the parse_elements function in the 802.11
 printer code (print-802_11.c) for tcpdump 3.9.5 and earlier allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted 802.11 frame. 
 NOTE: this was originally referred to as heap-based, but it might be
 stack-based.
