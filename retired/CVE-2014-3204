Description:
 Unity before 7.2.1, as used in Ubuntu 14.04, does not properly handle
 keyboard shortcuts, which allows physically proximate attackers to bypass
 the lock screen and execute arbitrary commands, as demonstrated by
 right-clicking on the indicator bar and then pressing the ALT and F2 keys.
