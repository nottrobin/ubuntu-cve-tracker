Description:
 The compile_branch function in PCRE before 8.37 allows context-dependent
 attackers to compile incorrect code, cause a denial of service
 (out-of-bounds heap read and crash), or possibly have other unspecified
 impact via a regular expression with a group containing a forward reference
 repeated a large number of times within a repeated outer group that has a
 zero minimum quantifier.
