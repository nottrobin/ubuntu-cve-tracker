Description:
 main/php_open_temporary_file.c in PHP before 5.5.28 and 5.6.x before 5.6.12
 does not ensure thread safety, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (race condition and heap memory corruption) by leveraging
 an application that performs many temporary-file accesses.
