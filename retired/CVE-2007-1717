Description:
 The mail function in PHP 4.0.0 through 4.4.6 and 5.0.0 through 5.2.1
 truncates e-mail messages at the first ASCIIZ ('\0') byte, which might
 allow context-dependent attackers to prevent intended information from
 being delivered in e-mail messages.  NOTE: this issue might be
 security-relevant in cases when the trailing contents of e-mail messages
 are important, such as logging information or if the message is expected to
 be well-formed.
