Description:
 The collator implementation in i18n/ucol.cpp in International Components
 for Unicode (ICU) 52 through SVN revision 293126, as used in Google Chrome
 before 40.0.2214.91, does not initialize memory for a data structure, which
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted character sequence.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> code in icu has changed, so no equivalent commit in icu tree
 mdeslaur> first google patch is buggy, as prevPos is getting set _after_
 mdeslaur> the getNextNormalizedChar
 mdeslaur> second google patch is buggy as source->endp is being checked
 mdeslaur> without checking the UCOL_ITER_HASLEN flag
