Description:
 Integer overflow in Firebird 2.0.0 allows remote authenticated users to
 cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via certain database operations
 with multi-byte character sets that trigger an attempt to use the value
 65536 for a 16-bit integer, which is treated as 0 and causes an infinite
 loop on zero-length data.
