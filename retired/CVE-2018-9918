Description:
 libqpdf.a in QPDF through 8.0.2 mishandles certain "expected dictionary key
 but found non-name object" cases, allowing remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (stack exhaustion), related to the QPDFObjectHandle and
 QPDF_Dictionary classes, because nesting in direct objects is not
 restricted.
