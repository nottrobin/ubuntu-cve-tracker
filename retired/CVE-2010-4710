Description:
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the addItem method in the Menu
 widget in YUI before 2.9.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
 script or HTML via a field that is added to a menu, related to
 documentation that specifies this field as a text field rather than an HTML
 field, a similar issue to CVE-2010-4569 and CVE-2010-4570.
