PublicDate: 2007-04-27
Candidate: CVE-2007-2348
References: 
Description:
 mirror --script in lftp before 3.5.9 does not properly quote shell
 metacharacters, which might allow remote user-assisted attackers to execute
 shell commands via a malicious script.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this
 issue crosses security boundaries, since the script already supports
 commands such as "get" which could overwrite executable files.
