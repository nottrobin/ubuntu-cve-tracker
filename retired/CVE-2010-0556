Description:
 browser/login/login_prompt.cc in Google Chrome before 4.0.249.89 populates
 an authentication dialog with credentials that were stored by Password
 Manager for a different web site, which allows user-assisted remote HTTP
 servers to obtain sensitive information via a URL that requires
 authentication, as demonstrated by a URL in the SRC attribute of an IMG
 element.
