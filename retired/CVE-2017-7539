Description:
 An assertion-failure flaw was found in Qemu before 2.10.1, in the Network
 Block Device (NBD) server's initial connection negotiation, where the I/O
 coroutine was undefined. This could crash the qemu-nbd server if a client
 sent unexpected data during connection negotiation. A remote user or
 process could use this flaw to crash the qemu-nbd server resulting in
 denial of service.
