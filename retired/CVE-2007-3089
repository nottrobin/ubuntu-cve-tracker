Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.5 does not prevent use of document.write to
 replace an IFRAME (1) during the load stage or (2) in the case of an
 about:blank frame, which allows remote attackers to display arbitrary HTML
 or execute certain JavaScript code, as demonstrated by code that intercepts
 keystroke values from window.event, aka the "promiscuous IFRAME access
 bug," a related issue to CVE-2006-4568.
