 allows remote attackers with read and write privileges for the encrypted
 repository to obtain potentially sensitive information by changing the
 manifest type byte of the repository to "unencrypted / without key file".
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Attic could be manipulated into running in unencrypted
 mode without warning the user. An attacker could use this vulnerability to
 access sensitive information.
