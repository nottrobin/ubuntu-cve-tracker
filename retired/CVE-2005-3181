Description:
 The audit system in Linux kernel 2.6.6, and other versions before 2.6.13.4,
 when CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL is enabled, uses an incorrect function to free
 names_cache memory, which prevents the memory from being tracked by
 AUDITSYSCALL code and leads to a memory leak that allows attackers to cause
 a denial of service (memory consumption).
