Description:
 The ippReadIO function in cups/ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS before 1.3.10 does
 not properly initialize memory for IPP request packets, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon
 crash) via a scheduler request with two consecutive IPP_TAG_UNSUPPORTED
 tags.
