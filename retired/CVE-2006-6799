Candidate: CVE-2006-6799
References:
Description:
 SQL injection vulnerability in Cacti 0.8.6i and earlier, when
 register_argc_argv is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 SQL commands via the (1) second or (2) third arguments to cmd.php.  NOTE:
 this issue can be leveraged to execute arbitrary commands since the SQL
 query results are later used in the polling_items array and popen function.
