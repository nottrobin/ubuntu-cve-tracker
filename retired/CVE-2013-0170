Description:
 Use-after-free vulnerability in the virNetMessageFree function in
 rpc/virnetserverclient.c in libvirt 1.0.x before 1.0.2, 0.10.2 before
 0.10.2.3, 0.9.11 before 0.9.11.9, and 0.9.6 before 0.9.6.4 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
 arbitrary code by triggering certain errors during an RPC connection, which
 causes a message to be freed without being removed from the message queue.
