Description:
 On Linux, if the secure computing mode BPF (seccomp-bpf) filter is running
 when the Gecko Media Plugin sandbox is started, the sandbox fails to be
 applied and items that would run within the sandbox are run protected only
 by the running filter which is typically weak compared to the sandbox.
 Note: this issue only affects Linux. Other operating systems are not
 affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 52 and Thunderbird < 52.
