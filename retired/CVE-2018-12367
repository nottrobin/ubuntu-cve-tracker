Description:
 In the previous mitigations for Spectre, the resolution or precision of
 various methods was reduced to counteract the ability to measure precise
 time intervals. In that work PerformanceNavigationTiming was not adjusted
 but it was found that it could be used as a precision timer. This
 vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60, Firefox ESR < 60.1, and Firefox <
 61.
