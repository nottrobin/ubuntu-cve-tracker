Description:
 Ganglia 3.1.7 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a
 direct request to a .php file, which reveals the installation path in an
 error message, as demonstrated by host_view.php and certain other files.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 debian> NOT-FOR-US: Web app path disclosure, not an issue (path is known anyway)
 msalvatore> I'm retiring this because the version of ganglia in trusty is
             3.6.0-1ubuntu2, vs the affected version of 3.1.7. Additionally,
             Debian has this labeled as "NOT-FOR-US".
