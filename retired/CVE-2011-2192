Description:
 The Curl_input_negotiate function in http_negotiate.c in libcurl 7.10.6
 through 7.21.6, as used in curl and other products, always performs
 credential delegation during GSSAPI authentication, which allows remote
 servers to impersonate clients via GSSAPI requests.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Richard Silverman discovered that when doing GSSAPI authentication,
 libcurl unconditionally performs credential delegation, handing the
 server a copy of the client's security credential. (CVE-2011-2192)
