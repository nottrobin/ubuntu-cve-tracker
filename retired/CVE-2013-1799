Description:
 Gnome Online Accounts (GOA) 3.6.x before 3.6.3 and 3.7.x before 3.7.91,
 does not properly validate SSL certificates when creating accounts for
 providers who use the libsoup library, which allows man-in-the-middle
 attackers to obtain sensitive information such as credentials by sniffing
 the network.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2013-0240.
