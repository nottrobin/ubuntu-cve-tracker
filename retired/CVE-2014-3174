Description:
 modules/webaudio/BiquadDSPKernel.cpp in the Web Audio API implementation in
 Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 37.0.2062.94, does not properly
 consider concurrent threads during attempts to update biquad filter
 coefficients, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (read of uninitialized memory) via crafted API calls.
