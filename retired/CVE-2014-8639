Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 35.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.4, Thunderbird
 before 31.4, and SeaMonkey before 2.32 do not properly interpret Set-Cookie
 headers within responses that have a 407 (aka Proxy Authentication
 Required) status code, which allows remote HTTP proxy servers to conduct
 session fixation attacks by providing a cookie name that corresponds to the
 session cookie of the origin server.
