Description:
 Use after free vulnerability in the _gnutls_handshake_hash_buffers_clear
 function in lib/gnutls_handshake.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS 2.3.5 through
 2.4.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or
 possibly execute arbitrary code via TLS transmission of data that is
 improperly used when the peer calls gnutls_handshake within a normal
 session, leading to attempted access to a deallocated libgcrypt handle.
