Description:
 Adobe Flash Player before 18.0.0.241 and 19.x before 19.0.0.185 on Windows
 and OS X and before 11.2.202.521 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 19.0.0.190,
 Adobe AIR SDK before 19.0.0.190, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before
 19.0.0.190 do not properly restrict the SWF file format, which allows
 remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks
 against JSONP endpoints, and obtain sensitive information, via a crafted
 OBJECT element with SWF content satisfying the character-set requirements
 of a callback API.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix
 for CVE-2014-4671 and CVE-2014-5333.
