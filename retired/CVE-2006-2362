 Buffer overflow in getsym in tekhex.c in libbfd in Free Software Foundation
 GNU Binutils before 20060423, as used by GNU strings, allows
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a file with a crafted
 Tektronix Hex Format (TekHex) record in which the length character is not a
 valid hexadecimal character.
