 Protect against large HTTP request DoS
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> Keystone on 11.10 is a pre-release version and unusable with other
  components such as nova and horizon
 jdstrand> per upstream (and me), change is to intrusive for stable release
  update and the upstream patch was rejected for Folsom and earlier. This is
  more of a feature than a vulnerability.
