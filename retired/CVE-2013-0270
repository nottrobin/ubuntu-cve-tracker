Description:
 OpenStack Keystone Grizzly before 2013.1, Folsom, and possibly earlier
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory
 consumption) via a large HTTP request, as demonstrated by a long
 tenant_name when requesting a token.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> Keystone on 11.10 is a pre-release version and unusable with other
  components such as nova and horizon
 jdstrand> per upstream (and me), change is to intrusive for stable release
  update and the upstream patch was rejected for Folsom and earlier. This is
  more of a feature than a vulnerability.
