Description:
 The Rust Programming Language Standard Library 1.34.x before 1.34.2
 contains a stabilized method which, if overridden, can violate Rust's
 safety guarantees and cause memory unsafety. If the `Error::type_id` method
 is overridden then any type can be safely cast to any other type, causing
 memory safety vulnerabilities in safe code (e.g., out-of-bounds write or
 read). Code that does not manually implement Error::type_id is unaffected.
