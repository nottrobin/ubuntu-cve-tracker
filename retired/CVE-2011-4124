 input validation issues
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> Ubuntu, from 10.10 (maverick) and after, uses the udisk-based
   shell script that Martin Pitt wrote instead of the upstream calibre
   setuid helper. In Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (lucid), the calibre package does
   not include the setuid helper at all.
