Description:
 The TSymbolTableLevel class in ANGLE, as used in Mozilla Firefox before
 47.0 and Firefox ESR 45.x before 45.2 on Windows, allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and application crash) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering use of a WebGL shader
 that writes to an array.
