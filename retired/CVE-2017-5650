Description:
 In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M18 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.12, the handling of
 an HTTP/2 GOAWAY frame for a connection did not close streams associated
 with that connection that were currently waiting for a WINDOW_UPDATE before
 allowing the application to write more data. These waiting streams each
 consumed a thread. A malicious client could therefore construct a series of
 HTTP/2 requests that would consume all available processing threads.
