Description:
 Code.cpp in Libgraphite in Graphite 2 1.2.4, as used in Mozilla Firefox
 before 43.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.6.1, does not consider recursive
 load calls during a size check, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted Graphite smart font.
