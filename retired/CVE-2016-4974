Description:
 Apache Qpid AMQP 0-x JMS client before 6.0.4 and JMS (AMQP 1.0) before
 0.10.0 does not restrict the use of classes available on the classpath,
 which might allow remote authenticated users with permission to send
 messages to deserialize arbitrary objects and execute arbitrary code by
 leveraging a crafted serialized object in a JMS ObjectMessage that is
 handled by the getObject function.
