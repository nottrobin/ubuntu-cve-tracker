Description:
 Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the logging code in Clam
 AntiVirus (ClamAV) before 0.88.1 might allow remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary code.  NOTE: as of 20060410, it is unclear whether this is a
 vulnerability, as there is some evidence that the arguments are actually
 being sanitized properly.
