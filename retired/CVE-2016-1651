Description:
 fxcodec/codec/fx_codec_jpx_opj.cpp in PDFium, as used in Google Chrome
 before 50.0.2661.75, does not properly implement the sycc420_to_rgb and
 sycc422_to_rgb functions, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information from process memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds
 read) via crafted JPEG 2000 data in a PDF document.
