Description:
 A non-privileged user or program can put code and a config file in a known
 non-privileged path (under C:/usr/local/) that will make curl <= 7.65.1
 automatically run the code (as an openssl "engine") on invocation. If that
 curl is invoked by a privileged user it can do anything it wants.
