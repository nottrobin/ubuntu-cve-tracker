Description:
 sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c in PHP before 5.3.13 and 5.4.x before 5.4.3, when
 configured as a CGI script (aka php-cgi), does not properly handle query
 strings that lack an = (equals sign) character, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by placing
 command-line options in the query string, related to lack of skipping a
 certain php_getopt for the 'T' case.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
 because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-1823.
