Description:
 Buffer overflow in sshbn.c in PuTTY before 0.63 allows remote SSH servers
 to cause a denial of service (crash) via an invalid DSA signature that is
 not properly handled during computation of a modular inverse and triggers
 the overflow during a division by zero by the bignum functionality, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2013-4206.
