Description:
 The DebuggerFunction::InitAgentHost function in
 browser/extensions/api/debugger/debugger_api.cc in Google Chrome before
 41.0.2272.76 does not properly restrict what URLs are available as debugger
 targets, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
 restrictions via a crafted extension.
