Description:
 An issue was discovered in HAProxy before 1.8.8. The incoming H2 frame
 length was checked against the max_frame_size setting instead of being
 checked against the bufsize. The max_frame_size only applies to outgoing
 traffic and not to incoming, so if a large enough frame size is advertised
 in the SETTINGS frame, a wrapped frame will be defragmented into a
 temporary allocated buffer where the second fragment may overflow the heap
 by up to 16 kB. It is very unlikely that this can be exploited for code
 execution given that buffers are very short lived and their addresses not
 realistically predictable in production, but the likelihood of an immediate
 crash is absolutely certain.
