Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the find_fixedlength function in
 pcre_compile.c in PCRE before 8.38 allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (crash) or obtain sensitive information from heap memory
 and possibly bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted regular
 expression with an excess closing parenthesis.
