Description:
 server/parser/sprite_definition.cpp in GNU Gnash (aka GNU Flash Player)
 0.7.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large number
 of SHOWFRAME elements within a DEFINESPRITE element, which triggers memory
 corruption and enables the attacker to call free with an arbitrary address,
 probably resultant from a buffer overflow.
