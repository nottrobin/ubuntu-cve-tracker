Description:
 A localhost.localdomain whitelist entry in valid_host() in
 scheduler/client.c in CUPS before 2.2.2 allows remote attackers to execute
 arbitrary IPP commands by sending POST requests to the CUPS daemon in
 conjunction with DNS rebinding. The localhost.localdomain name is often
 resolved via a DNS server (neither the OS nor the web browser is
 responsible for ensuring that localhost.localdomain is 127.0.0.1).
