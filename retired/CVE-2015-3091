Description:
 Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.289 and 14.x through 17.x before
 17.0.0.188 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.460 on Linux, Adobe AIR
 before 17.0.0.172, Adobe AIR SDK before 17.0.0.172, and Adobe AIR SDK &
 Compiler before 17.0.0.172 do not properly restrict discovery of memory
 addresses, which allows attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism
 via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-3092.
