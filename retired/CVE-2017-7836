Description:
 The "pingsender" executable used by the Firefox Health Report dynamically
 loads a system copy of libcurl, which an attacker could replace. This
 allows for privilege escalation as the replaced libcurl code will run with
 Firefox's privileges. Note: This attack requires an attacker have local
 system access and only affects OS X and Linux. Windows systems are not
 affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57.
