 Apache Tomcat 7.0.x before 7.0.17 permits web applications to replace an

 read or modify the (1) web.xml, (2) context.xml, or (3) tld files of
 arbitrary web applications via a crafted application that is loaded earlier
 than the target application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a
 CVE-2009-0783 regression.
