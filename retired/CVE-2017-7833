Description:
 Some Arabic and Indic vowel marker characters can be combined with Latin
 characters in a domain name to eclipse the non-Latin character with some
 font sets on the addressbar. The non-Latin character will not be visible to
 most viewers. This allows for domain spoofing attacks because these
 combined domain names do not display as punycode. This vulnerability
 affects Firefox < 57.
