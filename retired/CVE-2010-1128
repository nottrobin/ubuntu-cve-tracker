Description:
 The Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) in PHP before 5.2.13 does not
 provide the expected entropy, which makes it easier for context-dependent
 attackers to guess values that were intended to be unpredictable, as
 demonstrated by session cookies generated by using the uniqid function.
