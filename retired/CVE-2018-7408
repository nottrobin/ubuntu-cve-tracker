Description:
 An issue was discovered in an npm 5.7.0 2018-02-21 pre-release (marked as
 "next: 5.7.0" and therefore automatically installed by an "npm upgrade -g
 npm" command, and also announced in the vendor's blog without mention of
 pre-release status). It might allow local users to bypass intended
 filesystem access restrictions because ownerships of /etc and /usr
 directories are being changed unexpectedly, related to a "correctMkdir"
 issue.
