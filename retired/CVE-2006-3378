Candidate: CVE-2006-3378
References:
Description:
 passwd command in shadow in Ubuntu 5.04 through 6.06 LTS, when called with
 the -f, -g, or -s flag, does not check the return code of a setuid call,
 which might allow local users to gain root privileges if setuid fails in
 cases such as PAM failures or resource limits.
