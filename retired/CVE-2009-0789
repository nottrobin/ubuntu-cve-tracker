Description:
 OpenSSL before 0.9.8k on WIN64 and certain other platforms does not
 properly handle a malformed ASN.1 structure, which allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (invalid memory access and application crash)
 by placing this structure in the public key of a certificate, as
 demonstrated by an RSA public key.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> only affects platforms where sizeof(long) < sizeof(void *). These
  are equal on all releases/architectures, thus Ubuntu is not affected.
