Description:
 Redirection from an HTTP connection to a "data:" URL assigns the referring
 site's origin to the "data:" URL in some circumstances. This can result in
 same-origin violations against a domain if it loads resources from
 malicious sites. Cross-origin setting of cookies has been demonstrated
 without the ability to read them. Note: This issue only affects Firefox 49
 and 50. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 50.0.1.
