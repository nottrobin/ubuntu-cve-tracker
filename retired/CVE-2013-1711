Description:
 The XrayWrapper implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 23.0 and SeaMonkey
 before 2.20 does not properly address the possibility of an XBL scope
 bypass resulting from non-native arguments in XBL function calls, which
 makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
 attacks by leveraging access to an unprivileged object.
