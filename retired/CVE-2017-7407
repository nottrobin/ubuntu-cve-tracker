Description:
 The ourWriteOut function in tool_writeout.c in curl 7.53.1 might allow
 physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information from process
 memory in opportunistic circumstances by reading a workstation screen
 during use of a --write-out argument ending in a '%' character, which leads
 to a heap-based buffer over-read.
