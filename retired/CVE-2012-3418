Description:
 libpcp in Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) before 3.6.5 allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a
 PDU with the numcreds field value greater than the number of actual
 elements to the __pmDecodeCreds function in p_creds.c; (2) the string byte
 number value to the __pmDecodeNameList function in p_pmns.c; (3) the numids
 value to the __pmDecodeIDList function in p_pmns.c; (4) unspecified vectors
 to the __pmDecodeProfile function in p_profile.c; the (5) status number
 value or (6) string number value to the __pmDecodeNameList function in
 p_pmns.c; (7) certain input to the __pmDecodeResult function in p_result.c;
 (8) the name length field (namelen) to the DecodeNameReq function in
 p_pmns.c; (9) a crafted PDU_FETCH request to the __pmDecodeFetch function
 in p_fetch.c; (10) the namelen field in the __pmDecodeInstanceReq function
 in p_instance.c; (11) the buflen field to the __pmDecodeText function in
 p_text.c; (12) PDU_INSTANCE packets to the __pmDecodeInstance in
 p_instance.c; or the (13) c_numpmid or (14) v_numval fields to the
 __pmDecodeLogControl function in p_lcontrol.c, which triggers integer
 overflows, heap-based buffer overflows, and/or buffer over-reads.
