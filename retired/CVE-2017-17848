Description:
 An issue was discovered in Enigmail before 1.9.9. In a variant of
 CVE-2017-17847, signature spoofing is possible for multipart/related
 messages because a signed message part can be referenced with a cid: URI
 but not actually displayed. In other words, the entire containing message
 appears to be signed, but the recipient does not see any of the signed
 text.
