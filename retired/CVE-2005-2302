Candidate: CVE-2005-2302

Description:
 PowerDNS before 2.9.18, when allowing recursion to a restricted range of IP
 addresses, does not properly handle questions from clients that are denied
 recursion, which could cause a "blank out" of answers to those clients that
 are allowed to use recursion.
