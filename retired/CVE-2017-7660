Description:
 Apache Solr uses a PKI based mechanism to secure inter-node communication
 when security is enabled. It is possible to create a specially crafted node
 name that does not exist as part of the cluster and point it to a malicious
 node. This can trick the nodes in cluster to believe that the malicious
 node is a member of the cluster. So, if Solr users have enabled BasicAuth
 authentication mechanism using the BasicAuthPlugin or if the user has
 implemented a custom Authentication plugin, which does not implement either
 "HttpClientInterceptorPlugin" or "HttpClientBuilderPlugin", his/her servers
 are vulnerable to this attack. Users who only use SSL without basic
 authentication or those who use Kerberos are not affected.
