Description:
 inets in Erlang possibly 22.1 and earlier follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18
 and therefore does not protect applications from the presence of untrusted
 client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow
 remote attackers to redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an
 arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka
 an "httpoxy" issue.
