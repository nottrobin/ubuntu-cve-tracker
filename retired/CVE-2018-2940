Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE
 (subcomponent: Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java
 SE: 6u191, 7u181, 8u172 and 10.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u171. Easily
 exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network
 access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded.
 Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the
 attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
 unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE, Java SE Embedded
 accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
 typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or
 sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that
 comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
 vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers,
 that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an
 administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.3 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS
 Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
