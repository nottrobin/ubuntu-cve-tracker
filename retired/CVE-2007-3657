Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.4 allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service by opening multiple tabs in a popup window.  NOTE: this
 issue has been disputed by third party researchers, stating that "this does
 not crash on me, and I can't see a likely mechanism of action that would
 lead to a DoS condition."
Ubuntu-Description:
