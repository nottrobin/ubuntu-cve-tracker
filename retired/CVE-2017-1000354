Description:
 Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier are
 vulnerable to a login command which allowed impersonating any Jenkins user.
 The `login` command available in the remoting-based CLI stored the
 encrypted user name of the successfully authenticated user in a cache file
 used to authenticate further commands. Users with sufficient permission to
 create secrets in Jenkins, and download their encrypted values (e.g. with
 Job/Configure permission), were able to impersonate any other Jenkins user
 on the same instance.
