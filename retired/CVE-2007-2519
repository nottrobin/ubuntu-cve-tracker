Description:
 Directory traversal vulnerability in the installer in PEAR 1.0 through
 1.5.3 allows user-assisted remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files
 via a .. (dot dot) sequence in the (1) install-as attribute in the file
 element in package.xml 1.0 or the (2) as attribute in the install element
 in package.xml 2.0.  NOTE: it could be argued that this does not cross
 privilege boundaries in typical installations, since the code being
 installed could perform the same actions.
