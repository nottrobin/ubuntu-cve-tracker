Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before
 1.0.2g allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory
 corruption or NULL pointer dereference) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a long digit string that is mishandled by the (1) BN_dec2bn or
 (2) BN_hex2bn function, related to crypto/bn/bn.h and crypto/bn/bn_print.c.
