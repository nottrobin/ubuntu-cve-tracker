Description:
 The CSPSource::schemeMatches function in
 WebKit/Source/core/frame/csp/CSPSource.cpp in the Content Security Policy
 (CSP) implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
 48.0.2564.82, does not apply http policies to https URLs and does not apply
 ws policies to wss URLs, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
 determine whether a specific HSTS web site has been visited by reading a
 CSP report.
