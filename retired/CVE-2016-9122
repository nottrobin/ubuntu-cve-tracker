Description:
 go-jose before 1.0.4 suffers from multiple signatures exploitation. The
 go-jose library supports messages with multiple signatures. However, when
 validating a signed message the API did not indicate which signature was
 valid, which could potentially lead to confusion. For example, users of the
 library might mistakenly read protected header values from an attached
 signature that was different from the one originally validated.
