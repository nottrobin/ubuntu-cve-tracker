Description:
 SystemTap 1.7, 1.6.7, and probably other versions, when unprivileged mode
 is enabled, allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel
 memory or cause a denial of service (kernel panic and crash) via vectors
 related to crafted DWARF data, which triggers a read of an invalid pointer.
