Description:
 MySQL, when running on Windows, allows remote authenticated users with
 insert privileges on the mysql.func table to cause a denial of service
 (server hang) and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a request for a
 non-library file, which causes the Windows LoadLibraryEx function to block,
 or (2) a request for a function in a library that has the XXX_deinit or
 XXX_init functions defined but is not tailored for mySQL, such as
 jpeg1x32.dll and jpeg2x32.dll.
