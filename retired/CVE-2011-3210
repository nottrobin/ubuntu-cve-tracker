Description:
 The ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite functionality in OpenSSL 0.9.8 through
 0.9.8r and 1.0.x before 1.0.0e does not ensure thread safety during
 processing of handshake messages from clients, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via out-of-order
 messages that violate the TLS protocol.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> from upstream: applications are only affected by the CRL checking
  vulnerability if they enable OpenSSL's internal CRL checking which is off by
  default. For example by setting the verification flag X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK
  or X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK_ALL
 jdstrand> The following packages in main use this X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK*
  curl, dovecot, exim4, freeradius, ipsec-tools, krb5, libio-socket-ssl-perl,
  libnet-ssleay-perl, likewise-open, mysql-5.1, nmap, openldap, openvpn,
  postgresql-9.1, ruby1.8, squid, telepathy-gabble, telepathy-salut,
  wpasupplicant
 jdstrand> the above need to also support ECDH to be affected
