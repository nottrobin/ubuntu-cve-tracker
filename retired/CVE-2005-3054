Candidate: CVE-2005-3054
References:
 http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-207-1
Description:
 fopen_wrappers.c in PHP 4.4.0, and possibly other versions, does not
 properly restrict access to other directories when the open_basedir
 directive includes a trailing slash, which allows PHP scripts in one
 directory to access files in other directories whose names are substrings
 of the original directory.
