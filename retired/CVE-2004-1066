Description:
 The cmdline pseudofiles in (1) procfs on FreeBSD 4.8 through 5.3, and (2)
 linprocfs on FreeBSD 5.x through 5.3, do not properly validate a process
 argument vector, which allows local users to cause a denial of service
 (panic) or read portions of kernel memory.  NOTE: this candidate might be
 SPLIT into 2 separate items in the future.
