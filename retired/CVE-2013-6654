Description:
 The SVGAnimateElement::calculateAnimatedValue function in
 core/svg/SVGAnimateElement.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
 33.0.1750.117, does not properly handle unexpected data types, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect cast) or possibly
 have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.
