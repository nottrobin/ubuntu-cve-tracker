Description:
 The NetworkSyncCommandQueue function in network/network_command.cpp in
 OpenTTD before 1.0.3 does not properly clear a pointer in a linked list,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop
 and CPU consumption) via a crafted request, related to the client command
 queue.
