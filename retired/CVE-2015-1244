Description:
 The URLRequest::GetHSTSRedirect function in url_request/url_request.cc in
 Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90 does not replace the ws scheme with the
 wss scheme whenever an HSTS Policy is active, which makes it easier for
 remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network
 for WebSocket traffic.
