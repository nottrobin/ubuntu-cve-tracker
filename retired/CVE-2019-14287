Description:
 In Sudo before 1.8.28, an attacker with access to a Runas ALL sudoer
 account can bypass certain policy blacklists and session PAM modules, and
 can cause incorrect logging, by invoking sudo with a crafted user ID. For
 example, this allows bypass of !root configuration, and USER= logging, for
 a "sudo -u \#$((0xffffffff))" command.
