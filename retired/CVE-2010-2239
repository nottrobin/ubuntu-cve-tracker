Description:
 Red Hat libvirt, possibly 0.6.0 through 0.8.2, creates new images without
 setting the user-defined backing-store format, which allows guest OS users
 to read arbitrary files on the host OS via unspecified vectors.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> AppArmor in Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04 should protect the host OS, but
  an attacker in a virtual machine may be able to access files of another
  machine.
 jdstrand> Ubuntu 9.10's qemu-img and kvm-img both support '-F backingType', so
  hard code libvirt to use this
 jdstrand> Ubuntu 9.04's qemu-img and kvm-img do not support specifiying a
  backing store disk format, so we must autoprobe backing stores at this time.
  Qemu didn't gain this option until 0.11, and 9.04 has 0.10 and kvm 84. The
  changes to qemu/kvm are too invasive and regression-prone and therefore
  an update will not be provided for this CVE for Ubuntu 9.04.
