Description:
 Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier are
 vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution. An unauthenticated
 remote code execution vulnerability allowed attackers to transfer a
 serialized Java `SignedObject` object to the Jenkins CLI, that would be
 deserialized using a new `ObjectInputStream`, bypassing the existing
 blacklist-based protection mechanism. We're fixing this issue by adding
 `SignedObject` to the blacklist. We're also backporting the new HTTP CLI
 protocol from Jenkins 2.54 to LTS 2.46.2, and deprecating the
 remoting-based (i.e. Java serialization) CLI protocol, disabling it by
 default.
