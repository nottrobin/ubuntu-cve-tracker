Description:
 components/navigation_interception/intercept_navigation_resource_throttle.cc
 in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91 on Android does not properly restrict
 use of intent: URLs to open an application after navigation to a web site,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (loss of browser
 access to that site) via crafted JavaScript code, as demonstrated by
 pandora.com and the Pandora application, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2015-1205.
