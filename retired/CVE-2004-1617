Description:
 Lynx, lynx-ssl, and lynx-cur before 2.8.6dev.8 allow remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a web page or HTML email that
 contains invalid HTML including (1) a TEXTAREA tag with a large COLS value
 and (2) a large tag name in an element that is not terminated, as
 demonstrated by mangleme.  NOTE: a followup suggests that the relevant
 trigger for this issue is the large COLS value.
