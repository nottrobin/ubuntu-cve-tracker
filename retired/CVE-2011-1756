Description:
 modules/xmpp/serv_xmpp.c in Citadel 7.86 and earlier does not properly
 detect recursion during entity expansion, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted XML
 document containing a large number of nested entity references, a similar
 issue to CVE-2003-1564.
