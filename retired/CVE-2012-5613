Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  MySQL 5.5.19 and possibly other versions, and MariaDB
 5.5.28a and possibly other versions, when configured to assign the FILE
 privilege to users who should not have administrative privileges, allows
 remote authenticated users to gain privileges by leveraging the FILE
 privilege to create files as the MySQL administrator.  NOTE: the vendor
 disputes this issue, stating that this is only a vulnerability when the
 administrator does not follow recommendations in the product's installation
 documentation.  NOTE: it could be argued that this should not be included
 in CVE because it is a configuration issue.
