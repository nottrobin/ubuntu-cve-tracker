Description:
 Previously, Puppet operated on a model that a node with a valid certificate
 was entitled to all information in the system and that a compromised
 certificate allowed access to everything in the infrastructure. When a
 node's catalog falls back to the `default` node, the catalog can be
 retrieved for a different node by modifying facts for the Puppet run. This
 issue can be mitigated by setting `strict_hostname_checking = true` in
 `puppet.conf` on your Puppet master. Puppet 6.13.0 changes the default
 behavior for strict_hostname_checking from false to true. It is recommended
 that Puppet Open Source and Puppet Enterprise users that are not upgrading
 still set strict_hostname_checking to true to ensure secure behavior.
