Description:
 Off-by-one error in ICC profile chunk handling in the png_set_iCCP function
 in pngset.c in libpng before 1.0.29 beta1 and 1.2.x before 1.2.21 beta1
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted
 PNG image that prevents a name field from being NULL terminated.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> DoS on many systems
 jdstrand> theoretically not vulnerable because the affected code uses
   png_strncpy with bad args, but our versions use png_strcpy.  TODO:
   get reproducer and/or verify png_strcpy usage
 jdstrand> upstream did not provide reproducer. code not in existing versions
 jdstrand> fully fixed in 1.2.22
