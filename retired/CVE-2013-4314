Description:
 The X509Extension in pyOpenSSL before 0.13.1 does not properly handle a
 '\0' character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an
 X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
 arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate
 Certification Authority.
