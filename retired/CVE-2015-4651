Description:
 The dissect_wccp2r1_address_table_info function in
 epan/dissectors/packet-wccp.c in the WCCP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x
 before 1.12.6 does not properly determine whether enough memory is
 available for storing IP address strings, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.
