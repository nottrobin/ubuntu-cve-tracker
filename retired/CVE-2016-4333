Description:
 The HDF5 1.8.16 library allocating space for the array using a value from
 the file has an impact within the loop for initializing said array allowing
 a value within the file to modify the loop's terminator. Due to this, an
 aggressor can cause the loop's index to point outside the bounds of the
 array when initializing it.
