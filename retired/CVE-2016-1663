Description:
 The SerializedScriptValue::transferArrayBuffers function in
 WebKit/Source/bindings/core/v8/SerializedScriptValue.cpp in the V8 bindings
 in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 50.0.2661.94, mishandles certain
 array-buffer data structures, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a crafted web site.
