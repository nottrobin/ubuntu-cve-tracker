Description:
 The resolveImplicitLevels function in common/ubidi.c in the Unicode
 Bidirectional Algorithm implementation in ICU4C in International Components
 for Unicode (ICU) before 55.1 does not properly track directionally
 isolated pieces of text, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly execute arbitrary code via
 crafted text.
