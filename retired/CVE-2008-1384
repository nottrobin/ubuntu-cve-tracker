Description:
 Integer overflow in PHP 5.2.5 and earlier allows context-dependent
 attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly have unspecified other
 impact via a printf format parameter with a large width specifier, related
 to the php_sprintf_appendstring function in formatted_print.c and probably
 other functions for formatted strings (aka *printf functions).
