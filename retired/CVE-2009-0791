Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in the pdftops filter in CUPS 1.1.17, 1.1.22,
 and 1.3.7 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file that
 triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, possibly related to (1) Decrypt.cxx,
 (2) FoFiTrueType.cxx, (3) gmem.c, (4) JBIG2Stream.cxx, and (5)
 PSOutputDev.cxx in pdftops/.  NOTE: the JBIG2Stream.cxx vector may overlap
 CVE-2009-1179.
