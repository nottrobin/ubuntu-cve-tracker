Description:
 By design, BIND is intended to limit the number of TCP clients that can be
 connected at any given time. The number of allowed connections is a tunable
 parameter which, if unset, defaults to a conservative value for most
 servers. Unfortunately, the code which was intended to limit the number of
 simultaneous connections contained an error which could be exploited to
 grow the number of simultaneous connections beyond this limit. Versions
 affected: BIND 9.9.0 -> 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.6, 9.12.0 -> 9.12.4,
 9.14.0. BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition versions 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.5-S3,
 and 9.11.5-S5. Versions 9.13.0 -> 9.13.7 of the 9.13 development branch are
 also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for
 vulnerability to CVE-2018-5743.
