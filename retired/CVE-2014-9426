Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The apprentice_load function in libmagic/apprentice.c in the
 Fileinfo component in PHP through 5.6.4 attempts to perform a free
 operation on a stack-based character array, which allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or application crash) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.  NOTE: this is
 disputed by the vendor because the standard erealloc behavior makes the
 free operation unreachable.
