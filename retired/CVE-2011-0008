Description:
 A certain Fedora patch for parse.c in sudo before 1.7.4p5-1.fc14 on Fedora
 14 does not properly interpret a system group (aka %group) in the sudoers
 file during authorization decisions for a user who belongs to that group,
 which allows local users to leverage an applicable sudoers file and gain
 root privileges via a sudo command.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists
 because of a CVE-2009-0034 regression.
