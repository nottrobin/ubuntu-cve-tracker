Description:
 An invalid authentication sequence could result in the hostapd process
 terminating due to missing state validation steps when processing the SAE
 confirm message when in hostapd/AP mode. All version of hostapd with SAE
 support are vulnerable. An attacker may force the hostapd process to
 terminate, performing a denial of service attack. Both hostapd with SAE
 support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version
 2.7 are affected.
