Description:
 parse-packet.c in GnuPG (gpg) 1.4.3 and 1.9.20, and earlier versions,
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (gpg crash) and
 possibly overwrite memory via a message packet with a large length (long
 user ID string), which could lead to an integer overflow, as demonstrated
 using the --no-armor option.
