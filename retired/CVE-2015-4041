Description:
 The keycompare_mb function in sort.c in sort in GNU Coreutils through 8.23
 on 64-bit platforms performs a size calculation without considering the
 number of bytes occupied by multibyte characters, which allows attackers to
 cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application
 crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via long UTF-8 strings.
