Candidate: CVE-2007-1661
References:
Description:
 Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 7.3 backtracks too
 far when matching certain input bytes against some regex patterns in
 non-UTF-8 mode, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain
 sensitive information or cause a denial of service (crash), as demonstrated
 by the "\X?\d" and "\P{L}?\d" patterns.
