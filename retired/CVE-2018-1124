Description:
 procps-ng before version 3.3.15 is vulnerable to multiple integer overflows
 leading to a heap corruption in file2strvec function. This allows a
 privilege escalation for a local attacker who can create entries in procfs
 by starting processes, which could result in crashes or arbitrary code
 execution in proc utilities run by other users.
