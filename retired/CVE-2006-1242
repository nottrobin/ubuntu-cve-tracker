Candidate: CVE-2006-1242
References:

Description:
 The ip_push_pending_frames function in Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x before 2.6.16
 increments the IP ID field when sending a RST after receiving unsolicited
 TCP SYN-ACK packets, which allows remote attackers to conduct an Idle Scan
 (nmap -sI) attack, which bypasses intended protections against such
 attacks.
