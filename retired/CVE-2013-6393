Description:
 The yaml_parser_scan_tag_uri function in scanner.c in LibYAML before 0.1.5
 performs an incorrect cast, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via
 crafted tags in a YAML document, which triggers a heap-based buffer
 overflow.
