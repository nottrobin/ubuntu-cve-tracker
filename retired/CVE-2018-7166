 https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/august-2018-security-releases/
Description:
 In all versions of Node.js 10 prior to 10.9.0, an argument processing flaw
 can cause `Buffer.alloc()` to return uninitialized memory. This method is
 intended to be safe and only return initialized, or cleared, memory. The
 third argument specifying `encoding` can be passed as a number, this is
 misinterpreted by `Buffer's` internal "fill" method as the `start` to a
 fill operation. This flaw may be abused where `Buffer.alloc()` arguments
 are derived from user input to return uncleared memory blocks that may
 contain sensitive information.
