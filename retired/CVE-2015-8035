Description:
 The xz_decomp function in xzlib.c in libxml2 2.9.1 does not properly detect
 compression errors, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a
 denial of service (process hang) via crafted XML data.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> The test xz file does not trigger the DoS in our 2.9.2 builds.
  xz support was accidentally disabled in 2.9.2. Marking the devel release
  as 'needed' so that the build system fix
  (18b8988511b0954272cac4d6c3e6724f9dbf6e0a) doesn't slip in without this
  CVE fix.
