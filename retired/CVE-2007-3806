Description:
 The glob function in PHP 5.2.3 allows context-dependent attackers to cause
 a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via an invalid
 value of the flags parameter, probably related to memory corruption or an
 invalid read on win32 platforms, and possibly related to lack of
 initialization for a glob structure.
