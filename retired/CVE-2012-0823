Description:
 VP8 Codec SDK (libvpx) before 1.0.0 "Duclair" allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) via (1) unspecified "corrupt
 input" or (2) by "starting decoding from a P-frame," which triggers an
 out-of-bounds read, related to "the clamping of motion vectors in SPLITMV
 blocks".
