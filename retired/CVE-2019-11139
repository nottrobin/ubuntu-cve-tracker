Description:
 Improper conditions check in the voltage modulation interface for some
 Intel(R) Xeon(R) Scalable Processors may allow a privileged user to
 potentially enable denial of service via local access.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that certain Intel Xeon processors did not properly
 restrict access to a voltage modulation interface. A local privileged
 attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
