Description:
 Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 52, Firefox ESR 45.8, Firefox
 ESR 52, and Thunderbird 52. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory
 corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could
 be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird
 < 52.1, Firefox ESR < 45.9, Firefox ESR < 52.1, and Firefox < 53.
