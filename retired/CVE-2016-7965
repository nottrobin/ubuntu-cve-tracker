Description:
 DokuWiki 2016-06-26a and older uses $_SERVER[HTTP_HOST] instead of the
 baseurl setting as part of the password-reset URL. This can lead to
 phishing attacks. (A remote unauthenticated attacker can change the URL's
 hostname via the HTTP Host header.) The vulnerability can be triggered only
 if the Host header is not part of the web server routing process (e.g., if
 several domains are served by the same web server).
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ebarretto> Setting to ignored as upstream won't fix it.
 ebarretto> Maintainer note:
 ebarretto> Autodetecting the host is an important feature for setting up
 ebarretto> wiki farms and it is a major convenience factor for our users
 ebarretto> (on installation, on moving the wiki between servers and
 ebarretto> accessing it from different network locations), so I'm leaning
 ebarretto> towards a WONTFIX here.
