Description:
 seunshare in policycoreutils 2.2.5 is owned by root with 4755 permissions,
 and executes programs in a way that changes the relationship between the
 setuid system call and the getresuid saved set-user-ID value, which makes
 it easier for local users to gain privileges by leveraging a program that
 mistakenly expected that it could permanently drop privileges.
