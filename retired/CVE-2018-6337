Description:
 folly::secureRandom will re-use a buffer between parent and child processes
 when fork() is called. That will result in multiple forked children
 producing repeat (or similar) results. This affects HHVM 3.26 prior to
 3.26.3 and the folly library between v2017.12.11.00 and v2018.08.09.00.
