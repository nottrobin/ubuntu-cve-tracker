Description:
 The addslashes function in PHP 4.3.9 does not properly escape a NULL (/0)
 character, which may allow remote attackers to read arbitrary files in PHP
 applications that contain a directory traversal vulnerability in require or
 include statements, but are otherwise protected by the magic_quotes_gpc
 mechanism.  NOTE: this issue was originally REJECTed by its CNA before
 publication, but that decision is in active dispute.  This candidate may
 change significantly in the future as a result of further discussion.
