Description:
 The printing process can bypass local access protections to read files
 available through symlinks, bypassing local file restrictions. The printing
 process requires files in a specific format so arbitrary data cannot be
 read but it is possible that some local file information could be exposed.
 This vulnerability affects Firefox < 58.
