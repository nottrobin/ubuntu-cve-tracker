Description:
 lppasswd in CUPS 1.1.22, when run in environments that do not ensure that
 file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 are open when lppasswd is called, does not
 verify that the passwd.new file is different from STDERR, which allows
 local users to control output to passwd.new via certain user input that
 triggers an error message.
