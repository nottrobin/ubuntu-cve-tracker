Description:
 sudo, when linked with MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5), does not properly check
 whether a user can currently authenticate to Kerberos, which allows local
 users to gain privileges, in a manner unintended by the sudo security
 model, via certain KRB5_ environment variable settings.  NOTE: another
 researcher disputes this vulnerability, stating that the attacker must be
 "a user, who can already log into your system, and can already use sudo."
