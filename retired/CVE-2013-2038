Description:
 The NMEA0183 driver in gpsd before 3.9 allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (daemon termination) and possibly execute arbitrary code
 via a GPS packet with a malformed $GPGGA interpreted sentence that lacks
 certain fields and a terminator.  NOTE: a separate issue in the AIS driver
 was also reported, but it might not be a vulnerability.
