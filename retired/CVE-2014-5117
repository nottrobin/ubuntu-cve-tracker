Description:
 Tor before 0.2.4.23 and 0.2.5 before 0.2.5.6-alpha maintains a circuit
 after an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell is received by a client, which makes it
 easier for remote attackers to conduct traffic-confirmation attacks by
 using the pattern of RELAY and RELAY_EARLY cells as a means of
 communicating information about hidden service names.
