Description:
 The (1) dist or (2) distcheck rules in GNU Automake 1.11.1, 1.10.3, and
 release branches branch-1-4 through branch-1-9, when producing a
 distribution tarball for a package that uses Automake, assign insecure
 permissions (777) to directories in the build tree, which introduces a race
 condition that allows local users to modify the contents of package files,
 introduce Trojan horse programs, or conduct other attacks before the build
 is complete.
