Description:
 The Jenkins 2.73.1 and earlier, 2.83 and earlier remote API at
 /queue/item/(ID)/api showed information about tasks in the queue (typically
 builds waiting to start). This included information about tasks that the
 current user otherwise has no access to, e.g. due to lack of Item/Read
 permission. This has been fixed, and the API endpoint is now only available
 for tasks that the current user has access to.
