Description:
 Redland Raptor (aka libraptor) before 2.0.7, as used by OpenOffice 3.3 and
 3.4 Beta, LibreOffice before 3.4.6 and 3.5.x before 3.5.1, and other
 products, allows user-assisted remote attackers to read arbitrary files via
 a crafted XML external entity (XXE) declaration and reference in an RDF
 document.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Per Sweetchark, only a LibreOffice issue if using internal raptor
 jdstrand> Debian's patch for 1.4.21 from David Beckett based on patch sent to
  linux-distros@
 jdstrand> per RedHat, arbitrary code execution is possible as well
 jdstrand> 1.4.21-7 is claimed to be fixed in Debian. While a patch was added,
  the quilt series file was not updated so the patch was not applied.
