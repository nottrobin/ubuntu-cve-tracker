Cron will run update.sh once in a while.  For many of the historical
graphs, the current data is generated each run, but only saved on the
first Sunday run (to keep a historical weekly history).

Update for new release:
- for both supported.data and supported-src.data. These contain package counts
  for binaries and sources (respectively). Each row contains the package counts
  for all supported (not-EOL) releases for the duration of that release's
  supported status. The same is down for each column. For binaries, package
  counts can be determined with:
    $ cd $packages_mirror ; zcat ./dists/$LATEST_STABLE_RELEASE/main/binary-*/Packages.gz ./dists/$LATEST_STABLE_RELEASE/restricted/binary-*/Packages.gz | grep '^Package:' | sort -u | wc -l
  For sources, this can be determined with:
    $ cd $packages_mirror ; zcat ./dists/$LATEST_STABLE_RELEASE/main/source/Sources.gz ./dists/$LATEST_STABLE_RELEASE/restricted/source/Sources.gz | grep '^Package:' | sort -u | wc -l
  - take the last line of the file and add it above the commented line in the .template file
  - in the .template file, update the commented out release name to next release and adjust counts for EOL releases
  - in the .template file, add the new release column header name
  - in the .template file, add a 0 column to all lines (except the last uncommented line), making sure everything is sensible for package counts
- edit update.sh
  - update REL for the new release
  - increment INDEX by 1 (to match column in the .template files (excluding the
    newly added devel release, since we don't know its package counts yet))
- add to .bzrignore:
  - $REL-src.data
  - $REL.data
