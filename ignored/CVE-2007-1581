 http://php-security.org/2010/05/01/mops-2010-001-php-hash_update_file-already-freed-resource-access-vulnerability/index.html
Description:
 The resource system in PHP 5.0.0 through 5.2.1 allows context-dependent
 attackers to execute arbitrary code by interrupting the hash_update_file
 function via a userspace (1) error or (2) stream handler, which can then be
 used to destroy and modify internal resources.  NOTE: it was later reported
 that PHP 5.2 through 5.2.13 and 5.3 through 5.3.2 are also affected.
