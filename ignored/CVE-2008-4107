Description:
 The (1) rand and (2) mt_rand functions in PHP 5.2.6 do not produce
 cryptographically strong random numbers, which allows attackers to leverage
 exposures in products that rely on these functions for security-relevant
 functionality, as demonstrated by the password-reset functionality in
 Joomla! 1.5.x and WordPress before 2.6.2, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2008-2107, CVE-2008-2108, and CVE-2008-4102.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> as of 2009-04-10, unfixed in debian with following comment:
 mdeslaur> the rand() and mt_rand() functions were never said to be cryptographically strong
 mdeslaur> AFAICT, unfixed upstream also
 mdeslaur> more information here: http://www.suspekt.org/2008/08/17/mt_srand-and-not-so-random-numbers/
 mdeslaur> Let's ignore this also.
