Description:
 VMware Workstation 5.5.3 34685, when the "Enable copy and paste to and from
 this virtual machine" option is enabled, preserves clipboard data on the
 guest operating system after it was deleted on the host operating system,
 which might allow local users to read clipboard contents by moving the
 focus back to the host operating system.
