Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in libtidy, as used in the Tidy extension for PHP
 5.2.3 and possibly other products, allow context-dependent attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via (1) a long second argument to the
 tidy_parse_string function or (2) an unspecified vector to the
 tidy_repair_string function.  NOTE: this might only be an issue in
 environments where vsnprintf is implemented as a wrapper for vsprintf.
