Description: 
 A design error in the IEEE1394 specification allows attackers with
 physical access to a device to read and write to sensitive memory
 using a modified FireWire/IEEE 1394 client, thus bypassing intended
 restrictions that would normally require greater degrees of physical
 access to exploit. NOTE: this was reported in 2008 to affect Windows
 Vista, but some Linux-based operating systems have protection mechanisms
 against this attack.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 kees> This is a physical design issue with Firewire.  It can be mitigated
 via setting "options ohci1394 phys_dma=0" in a /etc/modprobe.d/ file, though
 this will greatly reduce the speed of your Firewire.
