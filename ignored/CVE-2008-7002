Description:
 PHP 5.2.5 does not enforce (a) open_basedir and (b) safe_mode_exec_dir
 restrictions for certain functions, which might allow local users to bypass
 intended access restrictions and call programs outside of the intended
 directory via the (1) exec, (2) system, (3) shell_exec, (4) passthru, or
 (5) popen functions, possibly involving pathnames such as "C:" drive
 notation.

 mdeslaur> The "PoC" doesn't turn on safe_mode, so of course
 mdeslaur> safe_mode_exec_dir doesn't work. Ignoring.
