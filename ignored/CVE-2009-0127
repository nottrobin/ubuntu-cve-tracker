Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** M2Crypto does not properly check the return value from the
 OpenSSL EVP_VerifyFinal, DSA_verify, ECDSA_verify, DSA_do_verify, and
 ECDSA_do_verify functions, which might allow remote attackers to bypass
 validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature, a
 similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.  NOTE: a Linux vendor disputes the
 relevance of this report to the M2Crypto product because "these functions
 are not used anywhere in m2crypto."
