Description:
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the mod_negotiation module in
 the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.6 and earlier in the 2.2.x series, 2.0.61 and
 earlier in the 2.0.x series, and 1.3.39 and earlier in the 1.3.x series
 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML by
 uploading a file with a name containing XSS sequences and a file extension,
 which leads to injection within a (1) "406 Not Acceptable" or (2) "300
 Multiple Choices" HTTP response when the extension is omitted in a request
 for the file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> Doesn't appear to be fixed by upstream or by vendors as of 2009-02-23
 mdeslaur> Need to be able to create a file with a special filename. If you can
 mdeslaur> do that, you can put the XSS directly in the file...so this isn't
 mdeslaur> really a security issue.
