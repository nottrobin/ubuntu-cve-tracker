Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in OpenOffice.org (OOo) allows remote attackers
 to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by a
 certain module in VulnDisco Pack Professional 8.8, aka "Client-side stack
 overflow exploit." NOTE: as of 20091005, this disclosure has no actionable
 information. However, because the VulnDisco Pack author is a reliable
 researcher, the issue is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking
 purposes.

  (just a crasher) and ignoring. Can reopen once more info is available
