    <h3 class="text-center">Context</h3>
<p>
The priorities assigned to vulnerabilities in Ubuntu are for prioritizing the
work of when CVEs will be fixed as opposed to just an assessment of severity,
importance or risk. The priority is based on many factors including severity,
importance, risk, install base, software configuration, active exploitation and
other factors which may adjust the impact of certain vulnerabilities such as
Ubuntu's <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Features#Matrix">
proactive security features</a>. Importantly, these priority levels are
distinct from other published severity levels such as CVSS as used in the
<a href="http://nvd.nist.gov/">National Vulnerability Database</a>).
</p>

<h3 class="text-center">Priority Descriptions</h3>
<table class="table table-bordered table-hover key">
    <thead class="thead-dark">
<tr><th>Priority</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    </thead>

<tr>
 <td class="key released">Not Vulnerable</td>
 <td class="key">
  Packages which do not exist in the archive, are not affected by the
  vulnerability or have a fix applied in the archive.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr>
 <td class="key pending">Pending</td>
 <td class="key">
  A fix has been applied and updated packages are awaiting arrival into the
  archive. For example, this might be used when wider testing is requested
  for the updated package.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr class="untriaged">
 <td class="key needed">Unknown</td>
 <td class="key">
  Open vulnerability where the priority is currently unknown and needs to be
  triaged.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr class="negligible">
 <td class="key needed">Negligible</td>
 <td class="key">
  Open vulnerability that may be a problem but otherwise does not impose a
  security risk due to various factors. Examples include when the vulnerability
  is only theoretical in nature, requires a very special situation, has almost
  no install base or does no real damage. These typically will not receive
  security updates unless there is an easy fix and some other issue causes an
  update.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr class="low">
 <td class="key needed">Low</td>
 <td class="key">
  Open vulnerability that is a problem but does very little damage or is
  otherwise hard to exploit due to small user base or other factors such as
  requiring specific environment, uncommon configuration, user assistance, etc.
  These tend to be included in security updates only when higher priority
  issues require an update or if many low priority issues have built up.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr class="medium">
 <td class="key needed">Medium</td>
 <td class="key">
  Open vulnerability that is a real problem and is exploitable for many users
  of the affected software. Examples include network daemon denial of service,
  cross-site scripting and gaining user privileges.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr class="high">
 <td class="key needed">High</td>
 <td class="key">
  Open vulnerability that is a real problem and is exploitable for many users
  in the default configuration of the affected software. Examples include
  serious remote denial of service of the system, local root privilege
  escalations or local data theft.
 </td>
</tr>

<tr class="critical">
 <td class="key needed">Critical</td>
 <td class="key">
  Open vulnerability that is a world-burning problem and is exploitable for
  most Ubuntu users. Examples include remote root privilege escalations or
  remote data theft.

</tr>
