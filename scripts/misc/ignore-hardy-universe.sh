#
# Sample script to help with mass triage.
# This will look at open hardy CVEs that are:
# - needed or needs-triage
# - low priority (by) default
#
# Then use mass-cve-edit to mark them 'ignored (reached end-of-life)'
#
# It would be nice if this was less of a hack and checked Assigned, so it
# could be used without worry.
#
# Usage:
# ./ignore-hardy-universe.sh <file> <prio>
#
# <file> is expected to be in the format of:
# CVE-2006-2219	phpbb2
# CVE-2006-2220	phpbb2
# CVE-2007-0255	xine-ui
# CVE-2007-0667	sql-ledger
#
# This can be obtained by going to:
# http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/universe.html
#
# Then holding Ctrl, click and highlight the CVE and Package fields and pasting
# them into a file.
