AppArmor is a core technology for application confinement for [[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/Specifications/ApplicationConfinement|Ubuntu Touch]] and [[https://developer.ubuntu.com/en/snappy/guides/security-policy/|Snappy for Ubuntu Core and Personal]].

Example profiles are found in the apparmor-profiles package from universe, and by-default shipped [[SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/AppArmorProfiles|enforcing profiles]] are being built up:

<<Include(SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/AppArmorProfiles, , from="=== Supported profiles in main ===", to="===")>>

Starting with Ubuntu 16.10, AppArmor can "stack" profiles so that the mediation decisions are made using the intersection of multiple profiles. This feature, combined with AppArmor profile namespaces, allows [[https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/|LXD]] to define a profile that an entire container will be confined with while still allowing individual, containerized processes to be further confined with profiles loaded inside of the container environment.

The common method of exploitation of [[https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=tmp+symlink|this flaw]] is crossing privilege boundaries when following a given symlink (i.e. a `root` user follows a symlink belonging to another user).

In Ubuntu 10.10 and later, symlinks in world-writable sticky directories (e.g. `/tmp`) cannot be followed if the follower and directory owner do not match the symlink owner.

If `/etc/` and `/home/` are on the same partition, a regular user can create a hardlink to `/etc/shadow` in their home directory. While it retains the original owner and permissions, it is possible for privileged programs that are otherwise symlink-safe to mistakenly access the file through its hardlink. Additionally, a very minor untraceable quota-bypassing local denial of service is possible by an attacker exhausting disk space by filling a world-writable directory with hardlinks.

In Ubuntu 10.10 and later, hardlinks cannot be created to files that the user would be unable to read and write originally, or are otherwise sensitive.
