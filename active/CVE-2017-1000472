Description:
 The ZipCommon::isValidPath() function in Zip/src/ZipCommon.cpp in POCO C++
 Libraries before 1.8 does not properly restrict the filename value in the
 ZIP header, which allows attackers to conduct absolute path traversal
 attacks during the ZIP decompression, and possibly create or overwrite
 arbitrary files, via a crafted ZIP file, related to a "file path injection
 vulnerability".
