Description:
 gnome-screensaver 2.26.1 relies on the gnome-session D-Bus interface to
 determine session idle time, even when an Xfce desktop such as Xubuntu or
 Mythbuntu is used, which allows physically proximate attackers to access an
 unattended workstation on which screen locking had been intended.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 kees> While it looks like a gnome-screensaver bug, for stable releases,
 kees> this is an issue primarily for xfce, which doesn't use g-ss correctly.
 kees> Going forward, gnome-session has been added to the g-ss package deps
 kees> so that the issue is more obvious to integration attempts of g-ss.
