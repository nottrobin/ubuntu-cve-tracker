Description:
 Buffer overflow in the log2vis_utf8 function in pyfribidi.c in GNU FriBidi
 0.19.1, 0.19.2, and possibly other versions, as used in PyFriBidi 0.10.1,
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted Arabic UTF-8 string that causes
 original 2-byte UTF-8 sequences to be transformed into 3-byte sequences.
