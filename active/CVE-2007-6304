Description:
 The federated engine in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.52, 5.1.x before 5.1.23, and
 6.0.x before 6.0.4, when performing a certain SHOW TABLE STATUS query, does
 not properly handle a response with a small number of columns, which allows
 remote MySQL servers to cause a denial of service (federated handler crash
 and daemon crash) via a response that lacks the minimum required number of
 columns.
