Description:
 Google Chrome before 4.0.211.0 cannot properly restrict modifications to
 cookies established in HTTPS sessions, which allows man-in-the-middle
 attackers to overwrite or delete arbitrary cookies via a Set-Cookie header
 in an HTTP response, related to lack of the HTTP Strict Transport Security
 (HSTS) includeSubDomains feature, aka a "cookie forcing" issue.
