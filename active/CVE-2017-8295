Description:
 WordPress through 4.7.4 relies on the Host HTTP header for a password-reset
 e-mail message, which makes it easier for remote attackers to reset
 arbitrary passwords by making a crafted wp-login.php?action=lostpassword
 request and then arranging for this message to bounce or be resent, leading
 to transmission of the reset key to a mailbox on an attacker-controlled
 SMTP server. This is related to problematic use of the SERVER_NAME variable
 in wp-includes/pluggable.php in conjunction with the PHP mail function.
 Exploitation is not achievable in all cases because it requires at least
 one of the following: (1) the attacker can prevent the victim from
 receiving any e-mail messages for an extended period of time (such as 5
 days), (2) the victim's e-mail system sends an autoresponse containing the
 original message, or (3) the victim manually composes a reply containing
 the original message.
