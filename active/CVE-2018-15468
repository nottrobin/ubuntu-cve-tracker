Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. The DEBUGCTL MSR contains
 several debugging features, some of which virtualise cleanly, but some do
 not. In particular, Branch Trace Store is not virtualised by the processor,
 and software has to be careful to configure it suitably not to lock up the
 core. As a result, it must only be available to fully trusted guests.
 Unfortunately, in the case that vPMU is disabled, all value checking was
 skipped, allowing the guest to choose any MSR_DEBUGCTL setting it likes. A
 malicious or buggy guest administrator (on Intel x86 HVM or PVH) can lock
 up the entire host, causing a Denial of Service.
