Description:
 If a local attacker can predict this filename, and precreates a
 symlink with the same filename that points to an arbitrary directory
 with mode 755, owner root and group root, then the attacker will
 succeed in making Phusion Passenger write files and create
 subdirectories inside that target directory.
