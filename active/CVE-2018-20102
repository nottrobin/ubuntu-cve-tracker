Description:
 An out-of-bounds read in dns_validate_dns_response in dns.c was discovered
 in HAProxy through 1.8.14. Due to a missing check when validating DNS
 responses, remote attackers might be able read the 16 bytes corresponding
 to an AAAA record from the non-initialized part of the buffer, possibly
 accessing anything that was left on the stack, or even past the end of the
 8193-byte buffer, depending on the value of accepted_payload_size.
