Description:
 The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x, 3.0.x, 3.1.x, and 3.2.x
 does not ensure that the declared data type of a database column is used
 during comparisons of input values to stored values in that column, which
 makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct data-type injection attacks
 against Ruby on Rails applications via a crafted value, as demonstrated by
 unintended interaction between the "typed XML" feature and a MySQL
 database.
