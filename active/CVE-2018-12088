Description:
 S3QL before 2.27 mishandles checksumming, and consequently allows replay
 attacks in which an attacker who controls the backend can present old
 versions of the filesystem metadata database as up-to-date, temporarily
 inject zero-valued bytes into files, or temporarily hide parts of files.
 This is related to the checksum_basic_mapping function.
