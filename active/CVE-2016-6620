Description:
 An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin. Some data is passed to the PHP
 unserialize() function without verification that it's valid serialized
 data. The unserialization can result in code execution because of the
 interaction with object instantiation and autoloading. All 4.6.x versions
 (prior to 4.6.4), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.8), and 4.0.x versions
 (prior to 4.0.10.17) are affected.
