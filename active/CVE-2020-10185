Description:
 The sync endpoint in YubiKey Validation Server before 2.40 allows remote
 attackers to replay an OTP. NOTE: this issue is potentially relevant to
 persons outside Yubico who operate a self-hosted OTP validation service
 with a non-default configuration such as an open sync pool; the issue does
 NOT affect YubiCloud.
