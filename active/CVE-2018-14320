Description:
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive
 information on vulnerable installations of PoDoFo. User interaction is
 required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a
 malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within
 PdfEncoding::ParseToUnicode. The issue results from the lack of proper
 validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption
 condition. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other
 vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current
 process. Was ZDI-CAN-5673.
