Description:
 Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.3.6 does not properly handle
 e-mail messages in which the From line contains UTF-8 characters associated
 with diacritical marks and an invalid charset, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (duplicate tickets and duplicate
 auto-responses) by sending a crafted message to a POP3 mailbox.
