Description:
 The make_clickable function in wp-includes/formatting.php in WordPress
 before 3.1.1 does not properly check URLs before passing them to the PCRE
 library, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
 via a comment with a crafted URL that triggers many recursive calls.
