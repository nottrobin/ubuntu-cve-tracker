Description:
 The ioQuake3 engine, as used in World of Padman 1.2 and earlier, Tremulous
 1.1.0, and ioUrbanTerror 2007-12-20, does not check for dangerous file
 extensions before writing to the quake3 directory, which allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted third-party addon that
 creates a Trojan horse DLL file, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2011-2764.
