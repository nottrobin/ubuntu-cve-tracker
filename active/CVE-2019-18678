Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid 3.x and 4.x through 4.8. It allows
 attackers to smuggle HTTP requests through frontend software to a Squid
 instance that splits the HTTP Request pipeline differently. The resulting
 Response messages corrupt caches (between a client and Squid) with
 attacker-controlled content at arbitrary URLs. Effects are isolated to
 software between the attacker client and Squid. There are no effects on
 Squid itself, nor on any upstream servers. The issue is related to a
 request header containing whitespace between a header name and a colon.
