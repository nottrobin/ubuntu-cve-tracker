Description:
 MultipartStream.java in Apache Commons FileUpload before 1.3.1, as used in
 Apache Tomcat, JBoss Web, and other products, allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a crafted
 Content-Type header that bypasses a loop's intended exit conditions.
