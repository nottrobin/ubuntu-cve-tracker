Description:
 In radare2 through 3.1.3, the assemble function inside
 libr/asm/p/asm_arm_cs.c allows attackers to cause a denial-of-service
 (application crash via an r_num_calc out-of-bounds read) by crafting an arm
 assembly input because a loop uses an incorrect index in armass.c and
 certain length validation is missing in armass64.c, a related issue to
 CVE-2018-20459.
