Description:
 email_in.pl in Bugzilla 2.23.4, 3.0.x before 3.0.3, and 3.1.x before 3.1.3
 allows remote authenticated users to more easily spoof the changer of a bug
 via a @reporter command in the body of an e-mail message, which overrides
 the e-mail address as normally obtained from the From e-mail header.  NOTE:
 since From headers are easily spoofed, this only crosses privilege
 boundaries in environments that provide additional verification of e-mail
 addresses.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 kees> this really should be for bugzilla3 but it's not in intrepid yet
 wgrant> our 2.x releases are too old, and 3.0.4 is too new.
