Description:
 The sqlite3VXPrintf function in printf.c in SQLite before 3.8.9 does not
 properly handle precision and width values during floating-point
 conversions, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (integer overflow and stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via large integers in a crafted printf function
 call in a SELECT statement.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 msalvatore> Some patches from the fix can be applied to the sqlite package.
             Marking this as needed.
