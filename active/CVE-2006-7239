Description:
 The _gnutls_x509_oid2mac_algorithm function in lib/gnutls_algorithms.c in
 GnuTLS before 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) via a crafted X.509 certificate that uses a hash algorithm that is
 not supported by GnuTLS, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> gnutls11 doesn't have the affected code:
  _gnutls_x509_oid2mac_algorithm located in lib/x509/common.c which compares to
  #defines from x509.h, not a pointer
 jdstrand> Hardy (gnutls13) and higher already have the corrected code
