Description:
 rxvt 2.6.4 opens a terminal window on :0 if the DISPLAY environment
 variable is not set, which might allow local users to hijack X11
 connections.  NOTE: it was later reported that rxvt-unicode, mrxvt, aterm,
 multi-aterm, and wterm are also affected.  NOTE: realistic attack scenarios
 require that the victim enters a command on the wrong machine.
