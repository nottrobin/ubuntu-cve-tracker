Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
 Libraries). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u201, 8u192
 and 11.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u191. Difficult to exploit vulnerability
 allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols
 to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks require human interaction from a
 person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability
 can result in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE accessible
 data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in
 clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java
 applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that
 comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This
 vulnerability does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers,
 that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an
 administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 3.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS
 Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that a memory disclosure issue existed in the
 OpenJDK Library subsystem. An attacker could use this to expose
 sensitive information and possibly bypass Java sandbox restrictions.
