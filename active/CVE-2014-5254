Description:
 [Symlink following issues]
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> Extensive unsafe use of /tmp leads me to believe the problems
  extend beyond just symlink or just hardlink issues, thus I'm not tagging
  this with the symlink-restriction or hardlink-restriction tags and I'm
  setting the Priority to "medium" rather than "low" as a result.
