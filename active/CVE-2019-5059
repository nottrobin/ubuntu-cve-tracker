Description:
 An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the XPM image
 rendering functionality of SDL2_image 2.0.4. A specially crafted XPM image
 can cause an integer overflow, allocating too small of a buffer. This
 buffer can then be written out of bounds resulting in a heap overflow,
 ultimately ending in code execution. An attacker can display a specially
 crafted image to trigger this vulnerability.
