Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** lighttpd before 1.4.54 has a signed integer overflow, which
 might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malicious HTTP GET
 request, as demonstrated by mishandling of /%2F? in
 burl_normalize_2F_to_slash_fix in burl.c. NOTE: The developer states "The
 feature which can be abused to cause the crash is a new feature in lighttpd
 1.4.50, and is not enabled by default. It must be explicitly configured in
 the config file (e.g. lighttpd.conf). Certain input will trigger an abort()
 in lighttpd when that feature is enabled. lighttpd detects the underflow or
 realloc() will fail (in both 32-bit and 64-bit executables), also detected
 in lighttpd. Either triggers an explicit abort() by lighttpd. This is not
 exploitable beyond triggering the explicit abort() with subsequent
 application exit."
