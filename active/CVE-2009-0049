Description:
 Belgian eID middleware (eidlib) 2.6.0 and earlier does not properly check
 the return value from the OpenSSL EVP_VerifyFinal function, which allows
 remote attackers to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a
 malformed SSL/TLS signature for DSA and ECDSA keys, a similar vulnerability
 to CVE-2008-5077.
