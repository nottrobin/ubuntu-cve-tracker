Description:
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MediaWiki before 1.16.5, when
 Internet Explorer 6 or earlier is used, allows remote attackers to inject
 arbitrary web script or HTML via an uploaded file accessed with a dangerous
 extension such as .shtml at the end of the query string, in conjunction
 with a modified URI path that has a %2E sequence in place of the . (dot)
 character.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix
 for CVE-2011-1578 and CVE-2011-1587.
