Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** CertificatePinner.java in OkHttp 3.x through 3.12.0 allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass certificate pinning by changing
 SSLContext and the boolean values while hooking the application. NOTE: This
 id is disputed because some parties don't consider this is a vulnerability.
 Their rationale can be found in
 https://github.com/square/okhttp/issues/4967.
