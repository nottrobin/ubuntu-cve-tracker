Description:
 A flaw was found in the pipe lookup plugin of ansible. Arbitrary commands
 can be run, when the pipe lookup plugin uses subprocess.Popen() with
 shell=True, by overwriting ansible facts and the variable is not escaped by
 quote plugin. An attacker could take advantage and run arbitrary commands
 by overwriting the ansible facts.
