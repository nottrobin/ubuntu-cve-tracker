Description:
 In OpenStack os-vif 1.15.x before 1.15.2, and 1.16.0, a hard-coded MAC
 aging time of 0 disables MAC learning in linuxbridge, forcing obligatory
 Ethernet flooding of non-local destinations, which both impedes network
 performance and allows users to possibly view the content of packets for
 instances belonging to other tenants sharing the same network. Only
 deployments using the linuxbridge backend are affected. This occurs in
 PyRoute2.add() in internal/command/ip/linux/impl_pyroute2.py.
