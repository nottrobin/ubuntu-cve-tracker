Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) 3.x, with certain
 settings of the SSL_ENABLE_RENEGOTIATION option, does not properly restrict
 client-initiated renegotiation within the SSL and TLS protocols, which
 might make it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU
 consumption) by performing many renegotiations within a single connection,
 a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1473.  NOTE: it can also be argued
 that it is the responsibility of server deployments, not a security
 library, to prevent or limit renegotiation when it is inappropriate within
 a specific environment.
