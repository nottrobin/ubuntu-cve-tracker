Description:
 The default configuration of Centre for Speech Technology Research (CSTR)
 Festival 1.95 beta (aka 2.0 beta) on Gentoo Linux, SUSE Linux, and possibly
 other distributions, is run locally with elevated privileges without
 requiring authentication, which allows local and remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary commands via the local daemon on port 1314, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2001-0956.  NOTE: this issue is local in some
 environments, but remote on others.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 kees> not as serious as in Gentoo, Debian's festival runs as nobody
 jdstrand> in addition to running as nobody, it also does not start on boot
   by default (must edit the initscript) in dapper - gutsy (but does on hardy)
 jdstrand> fix would likely include documentation fixes with a big warning in
   the initscript
 jstrand> fix not released for gutsy, as debian bug #435445 did not fully
   address the issue
 jdstrand> hardy runs server by default (1.96~beta-5ubuntu1)
 jdstrand> marked hardy as fixed-- don't start server by default, non-prvileged
   user and notes on using --server
