Description:
 The from_format function in ssmtp.c in ssmtp 2.61 and 2.62, in certain
 configurations, uses uninitialized memory for the From: field of an e-mail
 message, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information
 (memory contents) in opportunistic circumstances by reading a message.
