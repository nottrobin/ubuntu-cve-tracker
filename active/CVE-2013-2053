Description:
 Buffer overflow in the atodn function in Openswan before 2.6.39, when
 Opportunistic Encryption is enabled and an RSA key is being used, allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (pluto IKE daemon crash) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted DNS TXT records.  NOTE: this
 might be the same vulnerability as CVE-2013-2052 and CVE-2013-2054.
