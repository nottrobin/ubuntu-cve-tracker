Description:
 The (1) AgentInterface and (2) CustomerInterface components in Open Ticket
 Request System (OTRS) before 3.0.6 place cleartext credentials into the
 session data in the database, which makes it easier for context-dependent
 attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading the _UserLogin and
 _UserPW fields.
