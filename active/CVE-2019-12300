 https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot/wiki/OAuth-vulnerability-in-using-submitted-authorization-token-for-authentication
Description:
 Buildbot before 1.8.2 and 2.x before 2.3.1 accepts a user-submitted
 authorization token from OAuth and uses it to authenticate a user. If an
 attacker has a token allowing them to read the user details of a victim,
 they can login as the victim.
