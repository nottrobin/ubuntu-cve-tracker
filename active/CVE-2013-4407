Description:
 HTTP::Body::Multipart in the HTTP-Body 1.08, 1.17, and earlier module for
 Perl uses the part of the uploaded file's name after the first "."
 character as the suffix of a temporary file, which makes it easier for
 remote attackers to conduct attacks by leveraging subsequent behavior that
 may assume the suffix is well-formed.
