Description:
 A vulnerability was found in mod_auth_mellon before v0.14.2. If Apache is
 configured as a reverse proxy and mod_auth_mellon is configured to only let
 through authenticated users (with the require valid-user directive), adding
 special HTTP headers that are normally used to start the special SAML ECP
 (non-browser based) can be used to bypass authentication.
