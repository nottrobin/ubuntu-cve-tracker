Description:
 An issue was discovered in PHP before 5.6.40, 7.x before 7.1.26, 7.2.x
 before 7.2.14, and 7.3.x before 7.3.1. A heap-based buffer over-read in
 PHAR reading functions in the PHAR extension may allow an attacker to read
 allocated or unallocated memory past the actual data when trying to parse
 the file name, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-20783. This is
 related to phar_detect_phar_fname_ext in ext/phar/phar.c.
