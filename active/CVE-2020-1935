Description:
 In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99
 the HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line parsing that
 allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This led to a
 possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a
 reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header
 in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely.
