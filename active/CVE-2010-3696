Description:
 The fr_dhcp_decode function in lib/dhcp.c in FreeRADIUS 2.1.9, in certain
 non-default builds, does not properly handle the DHCP Relay Agent
 Information option, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (infinite loop and daemon outage) via a packet that has more than
 one sub-option.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party
 information.
