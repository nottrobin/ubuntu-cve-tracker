Description:
 Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
 actionscript/Jplayer.as in the Flash SWF component (jplayer.swf) in jPlayer
 before 2.2.23 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML
 via the (1) jQuery or (2) id parameters, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2013-1942 and CVE-2013-2023, as demonstrated by using the alert
 function in the jQuery parameter.  NOTE: these are the same parameters as
 CVE-2013-1942, but the fix for CVE-2013-1942 uses a blacklist for the
 jQuery parameter.
