Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component:
 Javadoc). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u231, 8u221,
 11.0.4 and 13. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated
 attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE.
 Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than the
 attacker and while the vulnerability is in Java SE, attacks may
 significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this
 vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to
 some of Java SE accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a
 subset of Java SE accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java
 deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start
 applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run
 untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the
 Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java
 deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code
 (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 4.7
 (Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the JavaDoc generator in OpenJDK did
 not properly filter out some HTML elements properly, including
 documentation comments in Java source code. An attacker could possibly
 use this to craft a Cross-Site Scripting attack.
