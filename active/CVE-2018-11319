 https://bugs.debian.org/894736
Description:
 Syntastic (aka vim-syntastic) through 3.9.0 does not properly handle
 searches for configuration files (it searches the current directory up to
 potentially the root). This improper handling might be exploited for
 arbitrary code execution via a malicious gcc plugin, if an attacker has
 write access to a directory that is a parent of the base directory of the
 project being checked. NOTE: exploitation is more difficult after 3.8.0
 because filename prediction may be needed.
