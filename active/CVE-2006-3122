Description:
 The supersede_lease function in memory.c in ISC DHCP (dhcpd) server 2.0pl5
 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash)
 via a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32 byte client-identifier, which causes
 the packet to be interpreted as a corrupt uid and causes the server to exit
 with "corrupt lease uid."
