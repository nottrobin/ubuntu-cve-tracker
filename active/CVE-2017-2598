Description:
 Secrets such as passwords are typically stored on disk and sent to users
 as part of some pages in encrypted form. These were encrypted using
 AES-128 ECB without IV, which exposes Jenkins and the stored secrets
 to unnecessary risks. Jenkins now encrypts secrets using AES-128 CBC
 with random IV.
