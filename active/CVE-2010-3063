Description:
 The php_mysqlnd_read_error_from_line function in the Mysqlnd extension in
 PHP 5.3 through 5.3.2 does not properly calculate a buffer length, which
 allows context-dependent attackers to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow
 via crafted inputs that cause a negative length value to be used.
