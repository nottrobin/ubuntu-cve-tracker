Description:
 The _validatePost function in libs/controller/components/security.php in
 CakePHP 1.3.x through 1.3.5 and 1.2.8 allows remote attackers to modify the
 internal Cake cache and execute arbitrary code via a crafted
 data[_Token][fields] value that is processed by the unserialize function,
 as demonstrated by modifying the file_map cache to execute arbitrary local
 files.
