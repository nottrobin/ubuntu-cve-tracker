Description:
 The GOsa_Filter_Settings cookie in GONICUS GOsa 2.7.5.2 is vulnerable to
 PHP objection injection, which allows a remote authenticated attacker to
 perform file deletions (in the context of the user account that runs the
 web server) via a crafted cookie value, because unserialize is used to
 restore filter settings from a cookie.
