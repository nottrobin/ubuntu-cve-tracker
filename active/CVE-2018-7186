Description:
 Leptonica before 1.75.3 does not limit the number of characters in a %s
 format argument to fscanf or sscanf, which allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a long string, as demonstrated by the
 gplotRead and ptaReadStream functions.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Leptonica incorrectly handled input arguments. An
 attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or other
 unspecified impact.
