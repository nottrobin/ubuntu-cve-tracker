Description:
 In ioquake3 before 2017-03-14, the auto-downloading feature has
 insufficient content restrictions. This also affects Quake III Arena,
 OpenArena, OpenJK, iortcw, and other id Tech 3 (aka Quake 3 engine) forks.
 A malicious auto-downloaded file can trigger loading of crafted
 auto-downloaded files as native code DLLs. A malicious auto-downloaded file
 can contain configuration defaults that override the user's. Executable
 bytecode in a malicious auto-downloaded file can set configuration
 variables to values that will result in unwanted native code DLLs being
 loaded, resulting in sandbox escape.
