Description:
 The is_enrolled function in lib/accesslib.php in Moodle 2.2.x before 2.2.4
 and 2.3.x before 2.3.1 does not properly interact with the caching feature,
 which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass an intended
 capability check via unspecified vectors that trigger caching of a user
 record.
