Description:
 OpenSSL before 0.9.8j, when SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG is
 enabled, does not prevent modification of the ciphersuite in the session
 cache, which allows remote attackers to force the use of a disabled cipher
 via vectors involving sniffing network traffic to discover a session
 identifier, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-4180.
