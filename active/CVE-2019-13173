 https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-4123-1
Description:
 fstream before 1.0.12 is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Overwrite. Extracting
 tarballs containing a hardlink to a file that already exists in the system,
 and a file that matches the hardlink, will overwrite the system's file with
 the contents of the extracted file. The fstream.DirWriter() function is
 vulnerable.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that npm/fstream incorrectly handled certain crafted
 tarballs. An attacker could use this vulnerability to write aritrary files to
 the filesystem.
Notes:
 ebarretto> According to a Github comment, the fix might not be enough.
