Description:
 Array index error in the make_table function in unlzh.c in the LZH
 decompression component in gzip 1.3.5, when running on certain platforms,
 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted GZIP archive that triggers an
 out-of-bounds write, aka a "stack modification vulnerability."
