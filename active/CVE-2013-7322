Description:
 usersfile.c in liboath in OATH Toolkit before 2.4.1 does not properly
 handle lines containing an invalid one-time-password (OTP) type and a user
 name in /etc/users.oath, which causes the wrong line to be updated when
 invalidating an OTP and allows context-dependent attackers to conduct
 replay attacks, as demonstrated by a commented out line when using
 libpam-oath.
