Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x. ARM never properly
 implemented grant table v2, either in the hypervisor or in Linux.
 Unfortunately, an ARM guest can still request v2 grant tables; they will
 simply not be properly set up, resulting in subsequent grant-related
 hypercalls hitting BUG() checks. An unprivileged guest can cause a BUG()
 check in the hypervisor, resulting in a denial-of-service (crash).
