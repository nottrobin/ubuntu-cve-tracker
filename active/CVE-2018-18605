Description:
 A heap-based buffer over-read issue was discovered in the function
 sec_merge_hash_lookup in merge.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD)
 library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31, because
 _bfd_add_merge_section mishandles section merges when size is not a
 multiple of entsize. A specially crafted ELF allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service, as demonstrated by ld.
