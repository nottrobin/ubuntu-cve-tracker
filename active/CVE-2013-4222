Description:
 OpenStack Identity (Keystone) Folsom, Grizzly 2013.1.3 and earlier, and
 Havana before havana-3 does not properly revoke user tokens when a tenant
 is disabled, which allows remote authenticated users to retain access via
 the token.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Debian states that the code is not present in Essex (as included in
  12.04 LTS)
 jdstrand> Essex does not invalidate user tokens when a tenant is disabled,
  but the 'keystone tenant-update --enable false ...' doesn't work to a bug in
  python-keystoneclient. This bug was fixed in the following commit:
  https://github.com/openstack/python-keystoneclient/commit/51f6cc6573319f66b6127d5f2b50e57949b59107
  but this is not available in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS as of 2013/10/22. Furthermore,
  on Essex token revocation is not limited to the tenant (this was introduced
  in https://github.com/openstack/keystone/commit/4e1a0867f9e9f42dd7c2abe3a10ca8a8f7dddce3)
  and this functionality is required for the deficiency described by this CVE
  to make any sense. Ignoring on 12.04 LTS since disabling a tenant doesn't
  work, revocation of users via tenants doesn't work as described in this CVE
  and because upstream considers this CVE a lack of a feature more than a
  security vulnerability.
