Description:
 An issue was discovered in chan_skinny.c in Asterisk Open Source 13.18.2
 and older, 14.7.2 and older, and 15.1.2 and older, and Certified Asterisk
 13.13-cert7 and older. If the chan_skinny (aka SCCP protocol) channel
 driver is flooded with certain requests, it can cause the asterisk process
 to use excessive amounts of virtual memory, eventually causing asterisk to
 stop processing requests of any kind.
