Description:
 In util-linux before 2.32-rc1, bash-completion/umount allows local users to
 gain privileges by embedding shell commands in a mountpoint name, which is
 mishandled during a umount command (within Bash) by a different user, as
 demonstrated by logging in as root and entering umount followed by a tab
 character for autocompletion.
Ubuntu-Description:

   util-linux in util-linux 2.28-1
