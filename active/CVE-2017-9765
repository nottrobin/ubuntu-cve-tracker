 https://www.genivia.com/changelog.html#Version_2.8.48_upd_(06/21/2017)
Description:
 Integer overflow in the soap_get function in Genivia gSOAP 2.7.x and 2.8.x
 before 2.8.48, as used on Axis cameras and other devices, allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
 (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) via a large XML
 document, aka Devil's Ivy. NOTE: the large document would be blocked by
 many common web-server configurations on general-purpose computers.
