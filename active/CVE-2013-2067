Description:
 java/org/apache/catalina/authenticator/FormAuthenticator.java in the form
 authentication feature in Apache Tomcat 6.0.21 through 6.0.36 and 7.x
 before 7.0.33 does not properly handle the relationships between
 authentication requirements and sessions, which allows remote attackers to
 inject a request into a session by sending this request during completion
 of the login form, a variant of a session fixation attack.
