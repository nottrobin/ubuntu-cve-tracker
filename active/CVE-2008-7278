Description:
 The S/MIME feature in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.2.5, and
 2.3.x before 2.3.0-beta1, does not properly configure the RANDFILE
 environment variable for OpenSSL, which might make it easier for remote
 attackers to decrypt e-mail messages that had lower than intended entropy
 available for cryptographic operations, related to inability to write to
 the seeding file.
