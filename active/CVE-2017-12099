Description:
 An exploitable integer overflow exists in the upgrade of the legacy Mesh
 attribute 'tface' of the Blender open-source 3d creation suite v2.78c. A
 specially crafted .blend file can cause an integer overflow resulting in a
 buffer overflow which can allow for code execution under the context of the
 application. An attacker can convince a user to open the file or use it as
 a library in order to trigger this vulnerability.
