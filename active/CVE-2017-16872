Description:
 An issue was discovered in Teluu pjproject (pjlib and pjlib-util) in PJSIP
 before 2.7.1. Parsing the numeric header fields in a SIP message (like
 cseq, ttl, port, etc.) all had the potential to overflow, either causing
 unintended values to be captured or, if the values were subsequently
 converted back to strings, a buffer overrun. This will lead to a potential
 exploit using carefully crafted invalid values.
