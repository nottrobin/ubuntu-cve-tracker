Description:
 etcd versions 3.2.x before 3.2.26 and 3.3.x before 3.3.11 are vulnerable to
 an improper authentication issue when role-based access control (RBAC) is
 used and client-cert-auth is enabled. If an etcd client server TLS
 certificate contains a Common Name (CN) which matches a valid RBAC
 username, a remote attacker may authenticate as that user with any valid
 (trusted) client certificate in a REST API request to the gRPC-gateway.
