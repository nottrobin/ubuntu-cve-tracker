Description:
 GKSu 2.0.2, when sudo-mode is not enabled, uses " (double quote) characters
 in a gksu-run-helper argument, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary
 commands in certain situations involving an untrusted substring within this
 argument, as demonstrated by an untrusted filename encountered during
 installation of a VirtualBox extension pack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> in Ubuntu, sudo-mode is the default, and the root account has
 mdeslaur> no password. On top of that, the fault actually lies in
 mdeslaur> VirtualBox that is not properly escaping the filename before
 mdeslaur> calling gksu.
