Description:
 The BN_from_montgomery function in crypto/bn/bn_mont.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8e
 and earlier does not properly perform Montgomery multiplication, which
 might allow local users to conduct a side-channel attack and retrieve RSA
 private keys.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that OpenSSL did not correctly perform Montgomery
 multiplications.  Local attackers might be able to reconstruct RSA
 private keys by examining another user's OpenSSL processes.
