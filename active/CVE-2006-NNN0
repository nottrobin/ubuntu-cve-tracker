Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> placeholder for one more fix for CVE-2006-2607. Marked as negligible
  since security impact is very low-- if initgroups() fails in cron_popen()
  then group privs are not dropped, and the MAILCMD is able to run with
  elevated group privileges. Can add this in on the next cron update.
