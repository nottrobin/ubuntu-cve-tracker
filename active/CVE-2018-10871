Description:
 389-ds-base before versions 1.3.8.5, 1.4.0.12 is vulnerable to a Cleartext
 Storage of Sensitive Information. By default, when the Replica and/or

 plaintext format in their respective changelog files. An attacker with
 sufficiently high privileges, such as root or Directory Manager, can query
 these files in order to retrieve plaintext passwords.
