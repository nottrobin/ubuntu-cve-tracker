Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in ide_dma_cb() in hw/ide/core.c in
 QEMU 2.4.0 through 4.2.0. The guest system can crash the QEMU process in
 the host system via a special SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND. It hits an assertion
 that implies that the size of successful DMA transfers there must be a
 multiple of 512 (the size of a sector). NOTE: a member of the QEMU security
 team disputes the significance of this issue because a "privileged guest
 user has many ways to cause similar DoS effect, without triggering this
 assert."
