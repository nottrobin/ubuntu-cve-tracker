Description:
 The Solaris pollset feature in the Event Port backend in poll/unix/port.c
 in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library before 1.3.9, as used in the
 Apache HTTP Server before 2.2.14 and other products, does not properly
 handle errors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (daemon hang) via unspecified HTTP requests, related to the prefork and
 event MPMs.
