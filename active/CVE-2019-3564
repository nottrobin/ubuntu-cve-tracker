Description:
 Go Facebook Thrift servers would not error upon receiving messages with
 containers of fields of unknown type. As a result, malicious clients could
 send short messages which would take a long time for the server to parse,
 potentially leading to denial of service. This issue affects Facebook
 Thrift prior to v2019.03.04.00.
