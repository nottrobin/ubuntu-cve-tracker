 https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/august-2018-security-releases/
Description:
 In all versions of Node.js prior to 6.14.4, 8.11.4 and 10.9.0 when used
 with UCS-2 encoding (recognized by Node.js under the names `'ucs2'`,
 `'ucs-2'`, `'utf16le'` and `'utf-16le'`), `Buffer#write()` can be abused to
 write outside of the bounds of a single `Buffer`. Writes that start from
 the second-to-last position of a buffer cause a miscalculation of the
 maximum length of the input bytes to be written.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Nikita Skovoroda  discovered that Node.js mishandled certain input, leading to
 an out of bounds write. An attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a
 denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
