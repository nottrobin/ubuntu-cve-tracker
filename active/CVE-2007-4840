Candidate: CVE-2007-4840
References: 
Description: 
 PHP 5.2.4 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
 service (application crash) via (1) a long string in the out_charset parameter
 to the iconv function; or a long string in the charset parameter to the (2)
 iconv_mime_decode_headers, (3) iconv_mime_decode, or (4) iconv_strlen function.
 NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability in most web server environments that
 support multiple threads, unless these issues can be demonstrated for code
 execution.
