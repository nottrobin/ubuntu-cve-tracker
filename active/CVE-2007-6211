Description:
 Send ICMP Nasty Garbage (sing) on Debian GNU/Linux allows local users to
 append to arbitrary files and gain privileges via the -L (output log file)
 option.  NOTE: this issue is only a vulnerability in limited environments,
 since sing is not installed setuid, and the administrator would need to
 override a non-setuid default during installation.
