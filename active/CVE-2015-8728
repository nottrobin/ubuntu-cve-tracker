Description:
 The Mobile Identity parser in (1) epan/dissectors/packet-ansi_a.c in the
 ANSI A dissector and (2) epan/dissectors/packet-gsm_a_common.c in the GSM A
 dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1
 improperly uses the tvb_bcd_dig_to_wmem_packet_str function, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and
 application crash) via a crafted packet.
