Description:
 uap-core before 0.7.3 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when
 processing crafted User-Agent strings. Some regexes are vulnerable to
 regular expression denial of service (REDoS) due to overlapping capture
 groups. This allows remote attackers to overload a server by setting the
 User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to maliciously crafted long
 strings. This has been patched in uap-core 0.7.3.
