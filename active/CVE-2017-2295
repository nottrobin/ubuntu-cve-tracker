Description:
 Versions of Puppet prior to 4.10.1 will deserialize data off the wire (from
 the agent to the server, in this case) with a attacker-specified format.
 This could be used to force YAML deserialization in an unsafe manner, which
 would lead to remote code execution. This change constrains the format of
 data on the wire to PSON or safely decoded YAML.
