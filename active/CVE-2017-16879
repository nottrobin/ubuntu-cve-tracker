Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the _nc_write_entry function in
 tinfo/write_entry.c in ncurses 6.0 allows attackers to cause a denial of
 service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a
 crafted terminfo file, as demonstrated by tic.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> The Debian bug suggests tic(1) is the only caller, in which case
  this would be a 'low' bug; I couldn't quickly verify this claim.
