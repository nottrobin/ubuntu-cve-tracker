Description:
 An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin involving improper enforcement of the
 IP-based authentication rules. When phpMyAdmin is used with IPv6 in a proxy
 server environment, and the proxy server is in the allowed range but the
 attacking computer is not allowed, this vulnerability can allow the
 attacking computer to connect despite the IP rules. All 4.6.x versions
 (prior to 4.6.4), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.8), and 4.0.x versions
 (prior to 4.0.10.17) are affected.
