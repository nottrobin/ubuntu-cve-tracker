Description:
 The Transformation implementation in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16,
 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 does not use the no-referrer
 Content Security Policy (CSP) protection mechanism, which makes it easier
 for remote attackers to conduct CSRF attacks by reading an authentication
 token in a Referer header, related to libraries/Header.php.
