Description:
 lib/fsm.c in RPM 4.8.0 and earlier does not properly reset the metadata of
 an executable file during replacement of the file in an RPM package upgrade
 or deletion of the file in an RPM package removal, which might allow local
 users to bypass intended access restrictions by creating a hard link to a
 vulnerable file that has a POSIX ACL, a related issue to CVE-2010-2059.
