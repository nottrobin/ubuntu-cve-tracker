 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command in the
 podcast playback function of Podbeuter in Newsbeuter 0.3 through 2.9 allows
 remote attackers to perform user-assisted code execution by crafting an RSS
 item with a media enclosure (i.e., a podcast file) that includes shell
 metacharacters in its filename, related to pb_controller.cpp and
 queueloader.cpp, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-12904.
