Description:
 Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle Java SE 5.0u55, 6u65, and 7u45; Java SE
 Embedded 7u45; and OpenJDK 7 allows remote attackers to affect
 confidentiality, integrity, and availability via vectors related to JNDI.
 NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2014 CPU. Oracle has not
 commented on third-party claims that the issue is related to missing
 package access checks in the Naming / JNDI component, which allows
 attackers to escape the sandbox.
