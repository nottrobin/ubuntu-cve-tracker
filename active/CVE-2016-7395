Description:
 SkPath.cpp in Skia, as used in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.89 on Windows
 and OS X and before 53.0.2785.92 on Linux, does not properly validate the
 return values of ChopMonoAtY calls, which allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (uninitialized memory access and application crash) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted graphics data.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 chrisccoulson> Fixed in the Skia bundled with Firefox since at least 50.0.
  Thunderbird has an older version of Skia in which this code doesn't exist
