Description:
 OpenSSH 5.6 and earlier, when J-PAKE is enabled, does not properly validate
 the public parameters in the J-PAKE protocol, which allows remote attackers
 to bypass the need for knowledge of the shared secret, and successfully
 authenticate, by sending crafted values in each round of the protocol, a
 related issue to CVE-2010-4252.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
  sbeattie> openssh in karmic and prior does not include J-PAKE auth
  support; in lucid and maverick it's present but not enabled at compile
  time. Added a QRT regression test that looks for client-side support.
