Description:
 An issue was discovered in Grafana 5.4.0. Passwords for data sources used
 by Grafana (e.g., MySQL) are not encrypted. An admin user can reveal
 passwords for any data source by pressing the "Save and test" button within
 a data source's settings menu. When watching the transaction with Burp
 Proxy, the password for the data source is revealed and sent to the server.
 From a browser, a prompt to save the credentials is generated, and the
 password can be revealed by simply checking the "Show password" box.
