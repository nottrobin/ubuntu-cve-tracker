Description:
 In ZeroMQ libzmq before 4.0.9, 4.1.x before 4.1.7, and 4.2.x before 4.3.2,
 a remote, unauthenticated client connecting to a libzmq application,
 running with a socket listening with CURVE encryption/authentication
 enabled, may cause a stack overflow and overwrite the stack with arbitrary
 data, due to a buffer overflow in the library. Users running public servers
 with the above configuration are highly encouraged to upgrade as soon as
 possible, as there are no known mitigations.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 It was discovered that ZeroMQ incorrectly handled certain application metadata.
 A remote attacker could use this issue to cause ZeroMQ to crash, or possibly
 execute arbitrary code.
