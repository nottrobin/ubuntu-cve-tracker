Description:
 Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.4 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File
 Overwrite. It fails to prevent existing globally-installed binaries to be
 overwritten by other package installations. For example, if a package was
 installed globally and created a serve binary, any subsequent installs of
 packages that also create a serve binary would overwrite the previous serve
 binary. This behavior is still allowed in local installations and also
 through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the
 --ignore-scripts install option.
