Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Varnish 2.0.6 writes data to a log file without sanitizing
 non-printable characters, which might allow remote attackers to modify a
 window's title, or possibly execute arbitrary commands or overwrite files,
 via an HTTP request containing an escape sequence for a terminal emulator.
 NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this report, stating that
 "This is not a security problem in Varnish or any other piece of software
 which writes a logfile. The real problem is the mistaken belief that you
 can cat(1) a random logfile to your terminal safely."
