Description:
 LAME through 3.99.5 relies on the signed integer data type for values in a
 WAV or AIFF header, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (stack-based buffer overflow or heap-based buffer overflow) or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file, as demonstrated
 by mishandling of num_channels.
