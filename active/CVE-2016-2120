Description:
 An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions up to and
 including 3.4.10, 4.0.1 allowing an authorized user to crash the server by
 inserting a specially crafted record in a zone under their control then
 sending a DNS query for that record. The issue is due to an integer
 overflow when checking if the content of the record matches the expected
 size, allowing an attacker to cause a read past the buffer boundary.
