Description: 
Ubuntu-Description: 
 KDE protocol handlers perform insufficient input validation, an attacker can
 craft malicious URI that would trigger JavaScript execution. Additionally the
 'help://' protocol handler suffer from directory traversal. It should be noted
 that the scope of this issue is limited as the malicious URIs cannot be
 embedded in Internet hosted content.
