Description:
 The mirroring support (-M, --use-mirrors) was implemented without
 any sort of authenticity checks and is downloaded over plaintext
 HTTP. Further more by default it will dynamically discover the list of
 available mirrors by querying a DNS entry and extrapolating from that
 data. It does not attempt to use any sort of method of securing this
 querying of the DNS like DNSSEC. Software packages are downloaded over
 these insecure links, unpacked, and then typically the setup.py python
 file inside of them is executed.
