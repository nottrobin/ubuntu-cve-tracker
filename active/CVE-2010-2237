Description:
 Red Hat libvirt, possibly 0.6.1 through 0.8.2, looks up disk backing stores
 without referring to the user-defined main disk format, which might allow
 guest OS users to read arbitrary files on the host OS, and possibly have
 unspecified other impact, via unknown vectors.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> AppArmor 10.04 should mostly protect the host OS, but an attacker in
  a virtual machine may be able to access files of another machine.
 jdstrand> upstream patch is highly intrusive, needs rewriting for all affected
  releases, requires a conffile change and a migration helper.
 jdstrand> Ubuntu 10.04 LTS is the first release to probe the backing stores
