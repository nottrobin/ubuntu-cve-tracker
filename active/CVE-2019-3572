 https://github.com/libming/libming/issues/169
Description:
 An issue was discovered in libming 0.4.8. There is a heap-based buffer
 over-read in the function writePNG in the file util/dbl2png.c of the
 dbl2png command-line program. Because this is associated with an erroneous
 call to png_write_row in libpng, an out-of-bounds write might occur for
 some memory layouts.
