Description: 
 The _gnutls_x509_verify_certificate function in lib/x509/verify.c in libgnutls
 in GnuTLS before 2.6.1 trusts certificate chains in which the last certificate
 is an arbitrary trusted, self-signed certificate, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to insert a spoofed certificate for any
 Distinguished Name (DN).
