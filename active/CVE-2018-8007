Description:
 Apache CouchDB administrative users can configure the database server via
 HTTP(S). Due to insufficient validation of administrator-supplied
 configuration settings via the HTTP API, it is possible for a CouchDB
 administrator user to escalate their privileges to that of the operating
 system's user that CouchDB runs under, by bypassing the blacklist of
 configuration settings that are not allowed to be modified via the HTTP
 API. This privilege escalation effectively allows an existing CouchDB admin
 user to gain arbitrary remote code execution, bypassing already disclosed
 CVE-2017-12636. Mitigation: All users should upgrade to CouchDB releases
 1.7.2 or 2.1.2.
