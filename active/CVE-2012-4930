Description:
 The SPDY protocol 3 and earlier, as used in Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome,
 and other products, can perform TLS encryption of compressed data without
 properly obfuscating the length of the unencrypted data, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP headers by observing
 length differences during a series of guesses in which a string in an HTTP
 request potentially matches an unknown string in an HTTP header, aka a
 "CRIME" attack.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> Firefox 15 disables compression
 jdstrand> For SPDY to be used with OpenSSL in any way, NPN must be available
  in openssl. This was not introduced until 1.0.1. No patch for upstream
  OpenSSL. This may be considered a flaw in the applications using OpenSSL and
  not OpenSSL itself.
