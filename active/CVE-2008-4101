Description:
 Vim 3.0 through 7.x before 7.2.010 does not properly escape characters,
 which allows user-assisted attackers to (1) execute arbitrary shell
 commands by entering a K keystroke on a line that contains a ";"
 (semicolon) followed by a command, or execute arbitrary Ex commands by
 entering an argument after a (2) "Ctrl-]" (control close-square-bracket) or
 (3) "g]" (g close-square-bracket) keystroke sequence, a different issue
 than CVE-2008-2712.
