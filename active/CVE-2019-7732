 https://github.com/rgaufman/live555/issues/20
Description:
 In Live555 0.95, a setup packet can cause a memory leak leading to DoS
 because, when there are multiple instances of a single field (username,
 realm, nonce, uri, or response), only the last instance can ever be freed.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ebarretto> According to upstream:
 ebarretto> Actually, this is not a memory leak. The parameters to
 ebarretto> “parseAuthorizationHeader()” are reference parameters (to pointers).
 ebarretto> The allocated memory is passed back to the calling function, which
 ebarretto> ends up deleting them all. So, there’s no bug here.
