Description:
 Multiple race conditions in ssl/t1_lib.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8f through 0.9.8o,
 1.0.0, and 1.0.0a, when multi-threading and internal caching are enabled on
 a TLS server, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
 client data that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, related to (1) the
 TLS server name extension and (2) elliptic curve cryptography.
