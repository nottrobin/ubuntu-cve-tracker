Description:
 Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in W3C Amaya Web Browser 10.0 and
 11.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a long type
 parameter in an input tag, which is not properly handled by the
 EndOfXmlAttributeValue function; (2) an "HTML GI" in a start tag, which is
 not properly handled by the ProcessStartGI function; and unspecified
 vectors in (3) html2thot.c and (4) xml2thot.c, related to the msgBuffer
 variable.  NOTE: these are different vectors than CVE-2008-6005.
