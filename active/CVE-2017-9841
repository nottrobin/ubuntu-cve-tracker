Description:
 Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php in PHPUnit before 4.8.28 and 5.x before 5.6.3
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via HTTP POST data
 beginning with a "<?php " substring, as demonstrated by an attack on a site
 with an exposed /vendor folder, i.e., external access to the
 /vendor/phpunit/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php URI.
