Description:
 An XSSI (cross-site inclusion) vulnerability in Jupyter Notebook before
 5.7.6 allows inclusion of resources on malicious pages when visited by
 users who are authenticated with a Jupyter server. Access to the content of
 resources has been demonstrated with Internet Explorer through capturing of
 error messages, though not reproduced with other browsers. This occurs
 because Internet Explorer's error messages can include the content of any
 invalid JavaScript that was encountered.
