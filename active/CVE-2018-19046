Description:
 keepalived 2.0.8 didn't check for existing plain files when writing data to
 a temporary file upon a call to PrintData or PrintStats. If a local
 attacker had previously created a file with the expected name (e.g.,
 /tmp/keepalived.data or /tmp/keepalived.stats), with read access for the
 attacker and write access for the keepalived process, then this potentially
 leaked sensitive information.
