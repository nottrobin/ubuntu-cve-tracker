Description:
 The NET_TCP_LISTEN function in net.c in Zabbix Agent before 1.6.7, when
 running on FreeBSD or Solaris, allows remote attackers to bypass the
 EnableRemoteCommands setting and execute arbitrary commands via shell
 metacharacters in the argument to net.tcp.listen.  NOTE: this attack is
 limited to attacks from trusted IP addresses.
