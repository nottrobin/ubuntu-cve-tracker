Description:
 A NULL pointer dereference was discovered in ifilter_bank of
 libfaad/filtbank.c in Freeware Advanced Audio Decoder 2 (FAAD2) 2.8.8. The
 vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash, which
 leads to denial of service because adding to windowed output is mishandled
 in the LONG_START_SEQUENCE case.
