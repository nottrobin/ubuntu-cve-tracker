Description:
 MP4Atom::factory in mp4atom.cpp in MP4v2 2.0.0 incorrectly uses the
 MP4ItemAtom data type in a certain case where MP4DataAtom is required,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted MP4
 file, because access to the data structure has different expectations about
 layout as a result of this type confusion.
