Description:
 The resolver in dnscache in Daniel J. Bernstein djbdns 1.05 overwrites
 cached server names and TTL values in NS records during the processing of a
 response to an A record query, which allows remote attackers to trigger
 continued resolvability of revoked domain names via a "ghost domain names"
 attack.
