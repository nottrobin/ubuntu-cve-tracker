Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in glyphs-eimage.c in XEmacs 21.4.22, when
 running on Windows, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) or execute arbitrary code via (1) the tiff_instantiate function
 processing a crafted TIFF file, (2) the png_instantiate function processing
 a crafted PNG file, and (3) the jpeg_instantiate function processing a
 crafted JPEG file, all which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.  NOTE:
 the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained
 solely from third party information.
