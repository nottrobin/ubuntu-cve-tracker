Description:
 pcs before version 0.9.164 and 0.10 is vulnerable to a privilege escalation
 via authorized user malicious REST call. The REST interface of the pcsd
 service did not properly sanitize the file name from the /remote/put_file
 query. If the /etc/booth directory exists, an authenticated attacker with
 write permissions could create or overwrite arbitrary files with arbitrary
 data outside of the /etc/booth directory, in the context of the pcsd
 process.
