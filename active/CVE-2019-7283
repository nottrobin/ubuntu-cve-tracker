Description:
 An issue was discovered in rcp in NetKit through 0.17. For an rcp
 operation, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the
 client. However, the rcp client only performs cursory validation of the
 object name returned. A malicious rsh server (or Man-in-The-Middle
 attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in a directory on the rcp client
 machine. This is similar to CVE-2019-6111.
