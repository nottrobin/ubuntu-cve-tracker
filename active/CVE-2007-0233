Candidate: CVE-2007-0233
References: 
Description:
 wp-trackback.php in WordPress 2.0.6 and earlier does not properly unset
 variables when the input data includes a numeric parameter with a value
 matching an alphanumeric parameter's hash value, which allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the tb_id parameter.  NOTE:
 it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a bug in the unset PHP
 command (CVE-2006-3017) and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then
 this should not be treated as a vulnerability in WordPress.
