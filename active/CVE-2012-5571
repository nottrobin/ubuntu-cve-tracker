Description:
 vulnerability in Keystone EC2-style credentials invalidation: when a user is
 removed from a tenant, issued EC2-style credentials would continue to be valid
 for that tenant. An authenticated and authorized user could potentially
 leverage this vulnerability to extend his access beyond the account owner
 expectations. Only setups enabling EC2-style credentials (for example enabling
 EC2 API in Nova) are affected.
