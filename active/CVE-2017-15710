Description:
 In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29,
 mod_authnz_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the
 Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when
 verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the
 charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a
 two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is
 truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an
 out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of
 the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash
 which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case,
 this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect
 at all.
