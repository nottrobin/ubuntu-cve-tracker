Description:
 t1lib 5.1.2 and earlier, as used in Xpdf before 3.02pl6 and other products,
 uses an invalid pointer in conjunction with a dereference operation, which
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Type 1 font
 in a PDF document, as demonstrated by testz.2184122398.pdf.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> xpdf in natty is now built with the poppler engine
