Description:
 The fnmatch implementation in apr_fnmatch.c in the Apache Portable Runtime
 (APR) library 1.4.3 and 1.4.4, and the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.18, allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a URI
 that does not match unspecified types of wildcard patterns, as demonstrated
 by attacks against mod_autoindex in httpd when a /*/WEB-INF/ configuration
 pattern is used.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect fix for
 CVE-2011-0419.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Is was discovered that the fix for CVE-2011-0419 introduced a different
 flaw in the fnmatch() implementation that could also result in a
 denial of service. (CVE-2011-1928)
