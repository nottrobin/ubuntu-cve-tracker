Description:
 The S/MIME feature in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.3.4 does
 not configure the RANDFILE and HOME environment variables for OpenSSL,
 which might make it easier for remote attackers to decrypt e-mail messages
 that had lower than intended entropy available for cryptographic
 operations, related to inability to write to the seeding file.
