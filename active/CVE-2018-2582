Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE
 (subcomponent: Hotspot). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE:
 8u152 and 9.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u151. Easily exploitable vulnerability
 allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols
 to compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human
 interaction from a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of
 this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or
 modification access to critical data or all Java SE, Java SE Embedded
 accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to client and server
 deployment of Java. This vulnerability can be exploited through sandboxed
 Java Web Start applications and sandboxed Java applets. It can also be
 exploited by supplying data to APIs in the specified Component without
 using sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, such
 as through a web service. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 6.5 (Integrity impacts). CVSS
 Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N).

 It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not
 properly validate uses of the invokeinterface JVM instruction. An
 attacker could possibly use this to access unauthorized resources.
