 https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/2888
Description:
 Asciidoctor in versions < 1.5.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (infinite loop). The loop was caused by the fact that
 Parser.next_block was not exhausting all the lines in the reader as the
 while loop expected it would. This was happening because the regular
 expression that detects any list was not agreeing with the regular
 expression that detects a specific list type. So the line kept getting
 pushed back onto the reader, hence causing the loop.
