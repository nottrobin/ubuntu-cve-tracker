Description:
 repository/s3/S3.php in the Amazon S3 library in Moodle through 2.2.11,
 2.3.x before 2.3.9, 2.4.x before 2.4.6, and 2.5.x before 2.5.2 does not
 verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's
 Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which
 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary
 valid certificate, related to an incorrect CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST value.
