Description:
 An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.9. URN response handling in Squid
 suffers from a heap-based buffer overflow. When receiving data from a
 remote server in response to an URN request, Squid fails to ensure that the
 response can fit within the buffer. This leads to attacker controlled data
 overflowing in the heap.
