Description:
 In Wireshark 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, 2.6.0 to 2.6.8, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.14, the
 dissection engine could crash. This was addressed in epan/packet.c by
 restricting the number of layers and consequently limiting recursion.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Wireshark improperly handled certain input. A remote or
 local attacker could cause Wireshark to crash by injecting malformed packets
 onto the wire or convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.
