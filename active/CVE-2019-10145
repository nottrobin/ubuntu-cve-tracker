Description:
 rkt through version 1.30.0 does not isolate processes in containers that
 are run with `rkt enter`. Processes run with `rkt enter` do not have
 seccomp filtering during stage 2 (the actual environment in which the
 applications run). Compromised containers could exploit this flaw to access
 host resources.
