Description:
 Elasticsearch Security versions 6.4.0 to 6.4.2 contain an error in the way
 request headers are applied to requests when using the Active Directory,
 LDAP, Native, or File realms. A request may receive headers intended for
 another request if the same username is being authenticated concurrently;
 when used with run as, this can result in the request running as the
 incorrect user. This could allow a user to access information that they
 should not have access to.
