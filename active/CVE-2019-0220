Description:
 A vulnerability was found in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 to 2.4.38. When the
 path component of a request URL contains multiple consecutive slashes
 ('/'), directives such as LocationMatch and RewriteRule must account for
 duplicates in regular expressions while other aspects of the servers
 processing will implicitly collapse them.
