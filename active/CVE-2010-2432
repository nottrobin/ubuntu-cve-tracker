Description:
 The cupsDoAuthentication function in auth.c in the client in CUPS before
 1.4.4, when HAVE_GSSAPI is omitted, does not properly handle a demand for
 authorization, which allows remote CUPS servers to cause a denial of
 service (infinite loop) via HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED responses.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> hardy and more recent are compiled with HAVE_GSSAPI support, so
 mdeslaur> we're not affected by this. Dapper doesn't seem to bail out
 mdeslaur> after a certain number of renegotiation attempts. This may be
 mdeslaur> a problem, need to investigate.
