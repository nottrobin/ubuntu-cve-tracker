Description:
 An issue was discovered in cairo.trm in Gnuplot 5.2.5. This issue allows an
 attacker to conduct a buffer overflow with an arbitrary amount of data in
 the cairotrm_options function. This flaw is caused by a missing size check
 of an argument passed to the "set font" function. This issue occurs when
 the Gnuplot pngcairo terminal is used as a backend.
