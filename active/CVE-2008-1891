Description:
 Directory traversal vulnerability in WEBrick in Ruby 1.8.4 and earlier,
 1.8.5 before 1.8.5-p231, 1.8.6 before 1.8.6-p230, 1.8.7 before 1.8.7-p22,
 and 1.9.0 before 1.9.0-2, when using NTFS or FAT filesystems, allows remote
 attackers to read arbitrary CGI files via a trailing (1) + (plus), (2) %2b
 (encoded plus), (3) . (dot), (4) %2e (encoded dot), or (5) %20 (encoded
 space) character in the URI, possibly related to the
 WEBrick::HTTPServlet::FileHandler and WEBrick::HTTPServer.new functionality
 and the :DocumentRoot option.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> this is only a problem if serving from a windows filesystem. This
   configuration is known to be broken. From changelog addition in svn r16454:
     Note: NTFS/FAT filesystem should not be published by the platforms
     other than Windows. Pathname interpretation (including short
     filename) is less than perfect.
