Description:
 The example code for the digest authentication functionality
 (http_authentication.rb) in Ruby on Rails before 2.3.3 defines an
 authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest block that returns nil instead of
 false when the user does not exist, which allows context-dependent
 attackers to bypass authentication for applications that are derived from
 this example by sending an invalid username without a password.
