 https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind/commit/6799f8f10cc78e9af6d443ed6982d00a13f2e7d2
Description:
 FasterXML jackson-databind before 2.7.9.3, 2.8.x before 2.8.11.1 and 2.9.x
 before 2.9.5 allows unauthenticated remote code execution because of an
 incomplete fix for the CVE-2017-7525 deserialization flaw. This is
 exploitable by sending maliciously crafted JSON input to the readValue
 method of the ObjectMapper, bypassing a blacklist that is ineffective if
 the c3p0 libraries are available in the classpath.
