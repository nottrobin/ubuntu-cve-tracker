Description:
 Log injection in SimpleSAMLphp before version 1.18.4. The
 www/erroreport.php script, which receives error reports and sends them via
 email to the system administrator, did not properly sanitize the report
 identifier obtained from the request. This allows an attacker, under
 specific circumstances, to inject new log lines by manually crafting this
 report ID. When configured to use the file logging handler, SimpleSAMLphp
 will output all its logs by appending each log line to a given file. Since
 the reportID parameter received in a request sent to www/errorreport.php
 was not properly sanitized, it was possible to inject newline characters
 into it, effectively allowing a malicious user to inject new log lines with
 arbitrary content.
