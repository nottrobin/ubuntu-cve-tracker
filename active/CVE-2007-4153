Description:
 Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in WordPress 2.2.1
 allow remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or
 HTML via (1) the Options Database Table in the Admin Panel, accessed
 through options.php; or (2) the opml_url parameter to link-import.php. 
 NOTE: this might not cross privilege boundaries in some configurations,
 since the Administrator role has the unfiltered_html capability.
