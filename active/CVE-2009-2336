Description:
 The forgotten mail interface in WordPress and WordPress MU before 2.8.1
 exhibits different behavior for a password request depending on whether the
 user account exists, which allows remote attackers to enumerate valid
 usernames.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly disputes the significance of this
 issue, indicating that the behavior exists for "user convenience."
