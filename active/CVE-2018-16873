Description:
 In Go before 1.10.6 and 1.11.x before 1.11.3, the "go get" command is
 vulnerable to remote code execution when executed with the -u flag and the
 import path of a malicious Go package, or a package that imports it
 directly or indirectly. Specifically, it is only vulnerable in GOPATH mode,
 but not in module mode (the distinction is documented at
 https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_aware_go_get). Using custom domains,
 it's possible to arrange things so that a Git repository is cloned to a
 folder named ".git" by using a vanity import path that ends with "/.git".
 If the Git repository root contains a "HEAD" file, a "config" file, an
 "objects" directory, a "refs" directory, with some work to ensure the
 proper ordering of operations, "go get -u" can be tricked into considering
 the parent directory as a repository root, and running Git commands on it.
 That will use the "config" file in the original Git repository root for its
 configuration, and if that config file contains malicious commands, they
 will execute on the system running "go get -u".

Notes:
 mdeslaur> Packages built using golang need to be rebuilt once the
 mdeslaur> vulnerability has been fixed. This CVE entry does not
 mdeslaur> list packages that need rebuilding outside of the main
 mdeslaur> repository or the Ubuntu variants with PPA overlays.
