Description:
 Multiple integer overflows in xine-lib 1.1.12, and other 1.1.15 and earlier
 versions, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or
 possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) crafted width and height values
 that are not validated by the mymng_process_header function in demux_mng.c
 before use in an allocation calculation or (2) crafted current_atom_size
 and string_size values processed by the parse_reference_atom function in
 demux_qt.c.
