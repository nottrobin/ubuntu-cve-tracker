Description:
 When Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.28, 8.5.0 to 8.5.47, 7.0.0 and 7.0.97 is
 configured with the JMX Remote Lifecycle Listener, a local attacker without
 access to the Tomcat process or configuration files is able to manipulate
 the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to capture user
 names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The attacker can then
 use these credentials to access the JMX interface and gain complete control
 over the Tomcat instance.
