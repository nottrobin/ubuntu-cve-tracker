Description:
 The resample_gauss function in resample.c in TiMidity++ 2.14.0 allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read)
 via a crafted mid file. NOTE: a crash might be relevant when using the
 --background option. NOTE: the TiMidity++ README.alsaseq documentation
 suggests a setuid-root installation.
