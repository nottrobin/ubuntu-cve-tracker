Description:
 In Claws Mail 3.14.1, an attacker in possession of S/MIME or PGP encrypted
 emails can wrap them as sub-parts within a crafted multipart email. The
 encrypted part(s) can further be hidden using HTML/CSS or ASCII newline
 characters. This modified multipart email can be re-sent by the attacker to
 the intended receiver. If the receiver replies to this (benign looking)
 email, they unknowingly leak the plaintext of the encrypted message part(s)
 back to the attacker.
