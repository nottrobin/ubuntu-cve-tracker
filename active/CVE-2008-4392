Description:
 dnscache in Daniel J. Bernstein djbdns 1.05 does not prevent simultaneous
 identical outbound DNS queries, which makes it easier for remote attackers
 to spoof DNS responses, as demonstrated by a spoofed A record in the
 Additional section of a response to a Start of Authority (SOA) query.
