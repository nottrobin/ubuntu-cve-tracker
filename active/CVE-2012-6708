 https://snyk.io/vuln/npm:jquery:20120206
Description:
 jQuery before 1.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
 The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in
 a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the
 input was HTML by looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string,
 giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to construct a malicious
 payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it
 explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitability only to
 attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less
 common.
