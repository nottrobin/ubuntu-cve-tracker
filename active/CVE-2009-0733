Description:
 Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the ReadSetOfCurves function in
 LittleCMS (aka lcms or liblcms) before 1.18beta2, as used in Firefox
 3.1beta, OpenJDK, and GIMP, allow context-dependent attackers to execute
 arbitrary code via a crafted image file associated with a large integer
 value for the (1) input or (2) output channel, related to the ReadLUT_A2B
 and ReadLUT_B2A functions.
