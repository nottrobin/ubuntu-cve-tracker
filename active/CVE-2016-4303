Description:
 The parse_string function in cjson.c in the cJSON library mishandles
 UTF8/16 strings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) or execute arbitrary code via a non-hex character in a JSON string,
 which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that iperf mishandled certain UTF8 and UTF16 strings. A
 remote attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service or
 possibly execute arbitrary code.
Notes:
 sbeattie> embedded copy of cjson?
