Description:
 The nfs_name_snoop_add_name function in epan/dissectors/packet-nfs.c in the
 NFS dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.13 and 1.10.x before 1.10.6
 does not validate a certain length value, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via a
 crafted NFS packet.
