Description:
 gnome-shell 3.22 through 3.24.1 mishandles extensions that fail to reload,
 which can lead to leaving extensions enabled in the lock screen. With these
 extensions, a bystander could launch applications (but not interact with
 them), see information from the extensions (e.g., what applications you
 have opened or what music you were playing), or even execute arbitrary
 commands. It all depends on what extensions a user has enabled. The problem
 is caused by lack of exception handling in js/ui/extensionSystem.js.
