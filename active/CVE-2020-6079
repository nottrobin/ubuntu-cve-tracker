Description:
 An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource
 allocation handling of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When encountering
 errors while parsing mDNS messages, some allocated data is not freed,
 possibly leading to a denial-of-service condition via resource exhaustion.
 An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly to trigger this
 vulnerability through decoding of the domain name performed by rr_decode.
