Description:
 The dissect_stun_message function in epan/dissectors/packet-stun.c in the
 STUN dissector in Wireshark 1.4.x before 1.4.15, 1.6.x before 1.6.10, and
 1.8.x before 1.8.2 does not properly interact with key-destruction behavior
 in a certain tree library, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (application crash) via a malformed packet.
