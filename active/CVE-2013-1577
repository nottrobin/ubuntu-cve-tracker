Description:
 The dissect_sip_p_charging_func_addresses function in
 epan/dissectors/packet-sip.c in the SIP dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before
 1.6.13 and 1.8.x before 1.8.5 does not properly handle offset data
 associated with a quoted string, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (infinite loop) via a malformed packet.
