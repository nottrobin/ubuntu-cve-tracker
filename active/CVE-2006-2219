Candidate: CVE-2006-2219
References: 
Description:
 phpBB 2.0.20 does not verify user-specified input variable types before
 being passed to type-dependent functions, which allows remote attackers to
 obtain sensitive information, as demonstrated by the (1) mode parameter to
 memberlist.php and the (2) highlight parameter to viewtopic.php that are
 used as an argument to the htmlspecialchars or urlencode functions, which
 displays the installation path in the resulting error message.
