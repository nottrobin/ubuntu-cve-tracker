Description:
 Google V8, as used in Google Chrome before 28.0.1500.95, allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via vectors that leverage "type confusion."
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> qtjsbackend-opensource-src contains an embedded libv8, however
  applications using qtjsbackend-opensource-src should not process untrusted
  javascript and therefore Ubuntu will not process updates for libv8 in this
  package. (See LP: #1157732 for details)
