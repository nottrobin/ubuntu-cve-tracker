Description:
 Stack consumption vulnerability in the WebCore::CSSSelector function in
 WebKit, as used in Apple Safari 4.0.4, Apple Safari on iPhone OS and iPhone
 OS for iPod touch, and Google Chrome 4.0.249, allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
 code via a STYLE element composed of a large number of *> sequences.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> webkit is a fork of khtml from kdelibs. kdelibs5 is farther from
  it, while qt4-x11 attempts to unify khtml and webkit.
 mdeslaur> webkitkde is a wrapper around qt4-x11's webkit.
 mdeslaur> looks like it was safari only
