Description:
 The JavaScript implementation in WebKit in Apple Safari before 5.0.3 on Mac
 OS X 10.5 through 10.6 and Windows, and before 4.1.3 on Mac OS X 10.4, uses
 a weak algorithm for generating values of random numbers, which makes it
 easier for remote attackers to track a user by predicting a value, a
 related issue to CVE-2008-5913 and CVE-2010-3171.
