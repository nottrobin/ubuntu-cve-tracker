Description:
 Security constraints defined by annotations of Servlets in Apache Tomcat
 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.4, 8.5.0 to 8.5.27, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.84
 were only applied once a Servlet had been loaded. Because security
 constraints defined in this way apply to the URL pattern and any URLs below
 that point, it was possible - depending on the order Servlets were loaded -
 for some security constraints not to be applied. This could have exposed
 resources to users who were not authorised to access them.
