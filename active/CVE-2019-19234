Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** In Sudo through 1.8.29, the fact that a user has been
 blocked (e.g., by using the ! character in the shadow file instead of a
 password hash) is not considered, allowing an attacker (who has access to a
 Runas ALL sudoer account) to impersonate any blocked user. NOTE: The
 software maintainer believes that this CVE is not valid. Disabling local
 password authentication for a user is not the same as disabling all access
 to that user--the user may still be able to login via other means (ssh key,
 kerberos, etc). Both the Linux shadow(5) and passwd(1) manuals are clear on
 this. Indeed it is a valid use case to have local accounts that are _only_
 accessible via sudo and that cannot be logged into with a password. Sudo
 1.8.30 added an optional setting to check the _shell_ of the target user
 (not the encrypted password!) against the contents of /etc/shells but that
 is not the same thing as preventing access to users with an invalid
 password hash.
