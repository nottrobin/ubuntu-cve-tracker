Description:
 In Apache Batik before 1.9, files lying on the filesystem of the server
 which uses batik can be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously
 formed SVG files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user
 context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is
 root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or sensitive
 files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability
 of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document
 can trivially trigger an amplification attack.
