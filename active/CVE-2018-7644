Description:
 The XmlSecLibs library as used in the saml2 library in SimpleSAMLphp before
 1.15.3 incorrectly verifies signatures on SAML assertions, allowing a
 remote attacker to construct a crafted SAML assertion on behalf of an
 Identity Provider that would pass as cryptographically valid, thereby
 allowing them to impersonate a user from that Identity Provider, aka a key
 confusion issue.
