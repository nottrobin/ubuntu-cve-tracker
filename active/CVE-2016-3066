Description:
 The spice-gtk widget allows remote authenticated users to obtain
 information from the host clipboard.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> Hans de Goede comments in the Red Hat bug that the clipboard
  synchronization can be turned off at the server. I'm marking this 'low'
  as a result of the configuration option being available.
