Description:
 In Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7, when configured with debug and a custom debug log
 file is set using debug_file, that file descriptor is not closed when a new
 process is spawned. This leads to the file descriptor being inherited into
 the child process; the child process can then read from and write to it.
 This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to
 fill the disk or plant misinformation.
