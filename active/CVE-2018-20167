Description:
 Terminology before 1.3.1 allows Remote Code Execution because popmedia is
 mishandled, as demonstrated by an unsafe "cat README.md" command when \e}pn
 is used. A popmedia control sequence can allow the malicious execution of
 executable file formats registered in the X desktop share MIME types
 (/usr/share/applications). The control sequence defers unknown file types
 to the handle_unknown_media() function, which executes xdg-open against the
 filename specified in the sequence. The use of xdg-open for all unknown
 file types allows executable file formats with a registered shared MIME
 type to be executed. An attacker can achieve remote code execution by
 introducing an executable file and a plain text file containing the control
 sequence through a fake software project (e.g., in Git or a tarball). When
 the control sequence is rendered (such as with cat), the executable file
 will be run.
