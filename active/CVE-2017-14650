Description:
 A Remote Code Execution vulnerability has been found in the Horde_Image
 library when using the "Im" backend that utilizes ImageMagick's "convert"
 utility. It's not exploitable through any Horde application, because the
 code path to the vulnerability is not used by any Horde code. Custom
 applications using the Horde_Image library might be affected. This
 vulnerability affects all versions of Horde_Image from 2.0.0 to 2.5.1, and
 is fixed in 2.5.2. The problem is missing input validation of the index
 field in _raw() during construction of an ImageMagick command line.
