Description:
 The krb5_save_ccname_done function in providers/krb5/krb5_auth.c in System
 Security Services Daemon (SSSD) 1.5.x before 1.5.7, when automatic ticket
 renewal and offline authentication are configured, uses a pathname string
 as a password, which allows local users to bypass Kerberos authentication
 by listing the /tmp directory to obtain the pathname.
