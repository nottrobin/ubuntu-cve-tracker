Candidate: CVE-2007-5715
References:
Description:
 DenyHosts 2.6 processes OpenSSH sshd "not listed in AllowUsers" log
 messages with an incorrect regular expression that does not match an IP
 address, which might allow remote attackers to avoid detection and blocking
 when making invalid login attempts with a username not present in
 AllowUsers, as demonstrated by the root username, a different vulnerability
 than CVE-2007-4323.
