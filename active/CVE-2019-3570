 https://hhvm.com/blog/2019/06/10/hhvm-4.9.0.html
Description:
 Call to the scrypt_enc() function in HHVM can lead to heap corruption by
 using specifically crafted parameters (N, r and p). This happens if the
 parameters are configurable by an attacker for instance by providing the
 output of scrypt_enc() in a context where Hack/PHP code would attempt to
 verify it by re-running scrypt_enc() with the same parameters. This could
 result in information disclosure, memory being overwriten or crashes of the
 HHVM process. This issue affects versions 4.3.0, 4.4.0, 4.5.0, 4.6.0,
 4.7.0, 4.8.0, versions 3.30.5 and below, and all versions in the 4.0, 4.1,
 and 4.2 series.
