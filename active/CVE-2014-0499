Description:
 Adobe Flash Player before 11.7.700.269 and 11.8.x through 12.0.x before
 12.0.0.70 on Windows and Mac OS X and before 11.2.202.341 on Linux, Adobe
 AIR before 4.0.0.1628 on Android, Adobe AIR SDK before 4.0.0.1628, and
 Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 4.0.0.1628 do not prevent access to address
