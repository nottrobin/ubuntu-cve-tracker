Description:
 Balabit syslog-ng 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 OSE and PE, when running on FreeBSD or
 HP-UX, does not properly perform cast operations, which causes syslog-ng to
 use a default value of -1 to create log files with insecure permissions
 (07777), which allows local users to read and write to these log files.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sbeattie> only affects people running syslog-ng on kfreebsd, as fchmod
 when passed with -1 doesn't change the mode on files.
