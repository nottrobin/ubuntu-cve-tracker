Description:
 An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the resource
 allocation handling of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When encountering
 errors while parsing mDNS messages, some allocated data is not freed,
 possibly leading to a denial-of-service condition via resource exhaustion.
 An attacker can send one mDNS message repeatedly to trigger this
 vulnerability through the function rr_read_RR [5] reads the current
 resource record, except for the RDATA section. This is read by the loop at
 in rr_read. For each RR type, a different function is called. When the RR
 type is 0x10, the function rr_read_TXT is called at [6].
