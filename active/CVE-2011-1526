Description:
 ftpd.c in the GSS-API FTP daemon in MIT Kerberos Version 5 Applications
 (aka krb5-appl) 1.0.1 and earlier does not check the krb5_setegid return
 value, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended group
 access restrictions, and create, overwrite, delete, or read files, via
 standard FTP commands, related to missing autoconf tests in a configure
 script.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 sbeattie> krb5-appl was split out from the krb5 package between hardy
 sbeattie> and lucid by upstream; the CVE covers two issues:
 sbeattie>   * the configure test for setegid() wasn't included when
 sbeattie>     krb5-appl was split out and so setegid is defined to
 sbeattie>     always return an error, which thus doesn't affect hardy
 sbeattie>   * the code never checks the return value of setegid, which
 sbeattie>     is a problem when setegid always fails, but less so when
 sbeattie>     the setegid() is a real call, though still a real issue.
 sbeattie>     hardy is affected by this, but less so than the split out
 sbeattie>     krb5-appl packages.
 sbeattie> Therefore I'm marking this priority low for hardy/krb5
