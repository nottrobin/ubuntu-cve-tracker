Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
 Security). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u221, 8u212
 and 11.0.3. Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated
 attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Java SE executes to
 compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in
 unauthorized access to critical data or complete access to all Java SE
 accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments,
 typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or
 sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code
 (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for
 security. This vulnerability can also be exploited by using APIs in the
 specified Component, e.g., through a web service which supplies data to the
 APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.1 (Confidentiality impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N).
Ubuntu-Description:
 Keegan Ryan discovered that the ECC implementation in OpenJDK was not
 sufficiently resilient to side-channel attacks. An attacker could
 possibly use this to expose sensitive information.
Notes:
 sbeattie> possibly does not affect openjdk-12
