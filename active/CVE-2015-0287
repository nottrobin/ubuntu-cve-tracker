Description:
 The ASN1_item_ex_d2i function in crypto/asn1/tasn_dec.c in OpenSSL before
 0.9.8zf, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0r, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1m, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2a
 does not reinitialize CHOICE and ADB data structures, which might allow
 attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid write operation and memory
 corruption) by leveraging an application that relies on ASN.1 structure
 reuse.
