Description:
 In Symfony before versions 5.0.5 and 4.4.5, some properties of the
 Exception were not properly escaped when the `ErrorHandler` rendered it

 configuration. The ErrorHandler now escape alls properties of the
 exception, and the stacktrace is only display in debug configuration. This
 issue is patched in symfony/http-foundation versions 4.4.5 and 5.0.5
