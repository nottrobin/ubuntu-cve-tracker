Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in Andy Lo-A-Foe AlsaPlayer 0.99.76 and earlier
 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash), or
 have other unknown impact, via (1) a long Location field sent by a web
 server, which triggers an overflow in the reconnect function in
 reader/http/http.c; (2) a long URL sent by a web server when AlsaPlayer is
 seeking a media file for the playlist, which triggers overflows in
 new_list_item and CbUpdated in interface/gtk/PlaylistWindow.cpp; and (3) a
 long response sent by a CDDB server, which triggers an overflow in
 cddb_lookup in input/ccda/cdda_engine.c.
