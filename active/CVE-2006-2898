Description:
 The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) for Asterisk 1.2.x before 1.2.9 and
 1.0.x before 1.0.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (crash) and execute arbitrary code via truncated IAX 2 (IAX2) video frames,
 which bypasses a length check and leads to a buffer overflow involving
 negative length check.  NOTE: the vendor advisory claims that only a DoS is
 possible, but the original researcher is reliable.
