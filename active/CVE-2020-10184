 https://github.com/Yubico/yubikey-val/releases/tag/yubikey-val-2.40
Description:
 The verify endpoint in YubiKey Validation Server before 2.40 does not check
 the length of SQL queries, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service, aka SQL injection. NOTE: this issue is potentially relevant to
 persons outside Yubico who operate a self-hosted OTP validation service;
 the issue does NOT affect YubiCloud.
