Candidate: CVE-2009-2061

Description:
 Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.10 processes a 3xx HTTP CONNECT response before
 a successful SSL handshake, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
 execute arbitrary web script, in an https site's context, by modifying this
 CONNECT response to specify a 302 redirect to an arbitrary https web site.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> https://www.paypal.com/ is the PoC site, but https://wiki.ubuntu.com
  seems to be a valid trigger as well (both set a cookie which is sent on
  connect). https://www.verisign.com will trigger the alert() in the PoC, but
  doesn't contain the cookie
 jdstrand> firefox-3.0 (3.0.9) is confirmed to be affected
 jdstrand> mozilla is silently fixing this in 3.0.10, but it won't be public
  until the CRD
 jdstrand> konqueror 3 (kdelibs) in dapper is confirmed to be affected
 jdstrand> konqueror 4 (kde4libs) in jaunty does not seem to be affected
  (displays it's own connection refused message for all 4xx codes)
 jdstrand> webkit on jaunty does not seem affected, though all of its consumers
  are rather flaky (midori, python-webkit/webbrowser.py, webkit/GtkLauncher,
  kazehakase-webkit). None of these would work with paypal or wiki.u.c, but
  would with https://www.verisign.com/. At verisign, firefox would display
  the PoC alert, but without the cookie. webkit, midori and python-webkit would
  not display the alert at all (kazehakase crashes on any page load). Other
  consumers are devhelp and anjuta, but I didn't see how to get an external
  page to load. At any rate, webkit is a tentative 'not-affected'. Will get
  more feedback from Debian maintainer.
 jdstrand> qt4-x11 in jaunty does not seem to be affected. arora is its
  browser consumer and it displays its own 'HTTP request failed' message for
  all 4xx codes
 jdstrand> also checked epiphany-webkit on 8.10. The browser can go to paypal,
  but is not vulnerable (does not display the alert at all for all 4xx codes)
