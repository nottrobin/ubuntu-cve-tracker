Description:
 A crafted S/MIME message consisting of an inner encryption layer and an
 outer SignedData layer was shown as having a valid digital signature,
 although the signer might have had no access to the contents of the
 encrypted message, and might have stripped a different signature from the
 encrypted message. Previous versions had only suppressed showing a digital
 signature for messages with an outer multipart/signed layer. This
 vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.1.1.
