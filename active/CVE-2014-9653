Description:
 readelf.c in file before 5.22, as used in the Fileinfo component in PHP
 before 5.4.37, 5.5.x before 5.5.21, and 5.6.x before 5.6.5, does not
 consider that pread calls sometimes read only a subset of the available
 data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (uninitialized memory access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via
 a crafted ELF file.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 tyhicks> readelf.c not used in php5
 tyhicks> readelf.c does not use pread() in Precise or Lucid but it looks like
  short read()'s are still a problem
