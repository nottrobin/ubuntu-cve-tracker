Description:
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Mahara 1.4.x before 1.4.5 and
 1.5.x before 1.5.4 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script
 or HTML by uploading an XML file with the xhtml extension, which is
 rendered inline as script.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with CVE-2012-2244
 to execute arbitrary code without authentication, as demonstrated by
 modifying the clamav path.
