Description:
 A 3rd party development library including with Drupal 8 development
 dependencies is vulnerable to remote code execution. This is mitigated by
 the default .htaccess protection against PHP execution, and the fact that
 Composer development dependencies aren't normal installed. You might be
 vulnerable to this if you are running a version of Drupal before 8.2.2. To
 be sure you aren't vulnerable, you can remove the <siteroot>/vendor/phpunit
 directory from your production deployments

Notes:
 ratliff> Ubuntu doesn't package drupal8 and it is unclear whether this
  vulnerability impacts drupal7, it needs a bit more investigation
