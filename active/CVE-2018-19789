 https://symfony.com/blog/cve-2018-19789-disclosure-of-uploaded-files-full-path
Description:
 An issue was discovered in Symfony 2.7.x before 2.7.50, 2.8.x before
 2.8.49, 3.x before 3.4.20, 4.0.x before 4.0.15, 4.1.x before 4.1.9, and
 4.2.x before 4.2.1. When using the scalar type hint `string` in a setter
 method (e.g. `setName(string $name)`) of a class that's the `data_class` of
 a form, and when a file upload is submitted to the corresponding field
 instead of a normal text input, then `UploadedFile::__toString()` is called
 which will then return and disclose the path of the uploaded file. If
 combined with a local file inclusion issue in certain circumstances this
 could escalate it to a Remote Code Execution.
