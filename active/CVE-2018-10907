Description:
 It was found that glusterfs server is vulnerable to multiple stack based
 buffer overflows due to functions in server-rpc-fopc.c allocating fixed
 size buffers using 'alloca(3)'. An authenticated attacker could exploit
 this by mounting a gluster volume and sending a string longer that the
 fixed buffer size to cause crash or potential code execution.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that GlusterFS incorrectly handled mounting volumes. An
 attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or
 run arbitrary code.
