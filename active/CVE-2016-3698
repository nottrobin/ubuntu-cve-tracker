Description:
 libndp before 1.6, as used in NetworkManager, does not properly validate
 the origin of Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) messages, which allows
 remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks or cause a denial of
 service (network connectivity disruption) by advertising a node as a router
 from a non-local network.
