Description:
 The compare_tor_addr_to_addr_policy function in or/policies.c in Tor before
 0.2.2.39, and 0.2.3.x before 0.2.3.21-rc, allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a zero-valued
 port field that is not properly handled during policy comparison.
