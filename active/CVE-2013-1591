Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in libpixman, as used in Pale Moon before 15.4
 and possibly other products, has unspecified impact and context-dependent
 attack vectors.  NOTE: this issue might be resultant from an integer
 overflow in the fast_composite_scaled_bilinear function in
 pixman-inlines.h, which triggers an infinite loop.
