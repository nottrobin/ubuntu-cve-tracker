Description:
 GitLab Community and Enterprise Editions version 8.4 up to 10.4 are
 vulnerable to XSS because a lack of input validation in the merge request
 component leads to cross site scripting (specifically, filenames in changes
 tabs of merge requests). This is fixed in 10.6.3, 10.5.7, and 10.4.7.
