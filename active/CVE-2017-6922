Description:
 In Drupal core 8.x prior to 8.3.4 and Drupal core 7.x prior to 7.56;
 Private files that have been uploaded by an anonymous user but not
 permanently attached to content on the site should only be visible to the
 anonymous user that uploaded them, rather than all anonymous users. Drupal
 core did not previously provide this protection, allowing an access bypass
 vulnerability to occur. This issue is mitigated by the fact that in order
 to be affected, the site must allow anonymous users to upload files into a
 private file system.
