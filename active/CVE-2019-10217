Description:
 A flaw was found in ansible 2.8.0 before 2.8.4. Fields managing sensitive
 data should be set as such by no_log feature. Some of these fields in GCP
 modules are not set properly. service_account_contents() which is common
 class for all gcp modules is not setting no_log to True. Any sensitive data
 managed by that function would be leak as an output when running ansible
 playbooks.
