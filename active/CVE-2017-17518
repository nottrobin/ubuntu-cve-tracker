Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** swt/motif/browser.c in White_dune (aka whitedune) 0.30.10
 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the
 BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct
 argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL. NOTE: This issue is being
 disputed as not being a vulnerability because ?the current version of
 white_dune (1.369 at https://wdune.ourproject.org/) do not use a "BROWSER
 environment variable". Instead, the "browser" variable is read from the
 $HOME/.dunerc file (or from the M$Windows registry). It is configurable in
 the "options" menu. The default is chosen in the ./configure script, which
 tests various programs, first tested is "xdg-open".?
