Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** In ncurses, possibly a 6.x version, there is a NULL pointer
 dereference at the function _nc_name_match that will lead to a denial of
 service attack. NOTE: the original report stated version 6.1, but the issue
 did not reproduce for that version according to the maintainer or a
 reliable third-party.
