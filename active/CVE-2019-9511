Description:
 Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to window size manipulation and
 stream prioritization manipulation, potentially leading to a denial of
 service. The attacker requests a large amount of data from a specified
 resource over multiple streams. They manipulate window size and stream
 priority to force the server to queue the data in 1-byte chunks. Depending
 on how efficiently this data is queued, this can consume excess CPU,
 memory, or both.
