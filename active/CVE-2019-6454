Description:
 An issue was discovered in sd-bus in systemd 239. bus_process_object() in
 libsystemd/sd-bus/bus-objects.c allocates a variable-length stack buffer
 for temporarily storing the object path of incoming D-Bus messages. An
 unprivileged local user can exploit this by sending a specially crafted
 message to PID1, causing the stack pointer to jump over the stack guard
 pages into an unmapped memory region and trigger a denial of service
 (systemd PID1 crash and kernel panic).
