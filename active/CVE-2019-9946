Description:
 Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) CNI (Container Networking
 Interface) 0.7.4 has a network firewall misconfiguration which affects
 Kubernetes. The CNI 'portmap' plugin, used to setup HostPorts for CNI,
 inserts rules at the front of the iptables nat chains; which take
 precedence over the KUBE- SERVICES chain. Because of this, the
 HostPort/portmap rule could match incoming traffic even if there were
 better fitting, more specific service definition rules like NodePorts later
 in the chain. The issue is fixed in CNI 0.7.5 and Kubernetes 1.11.9,
 1.12.7, 1.13.5, and 1.14.0.
