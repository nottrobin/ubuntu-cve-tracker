Description:
 The gen_rand_string function in phpBB 2.0.19 uses insufficiently random
 data (small value space) to create the activation key ("validation ID")
 that is sent by e-mail when establishing a password, which makes it easier
 for remote attackers to obtain the key and modify passwords for existing
 accounts or create new accounts.
