Description:
 Buffer overflow in gif2png.c in gif2png 2.5.3 and earlier might allow
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) or have unspecified other impact via a GIF file that contains many
 images, leading to long extensions such as .p100 for PNG output files, as
 demonstrated by a CGI program that launches gif2png, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2009-5018.
