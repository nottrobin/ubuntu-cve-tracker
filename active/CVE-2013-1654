Description: 
 A vulnerability has been found in Puppet that could allow a client
 negotiating a connection to a master to downgrade the master’s SSL
 protocol to SSLv2. This protocol has been found to contain design
 weaknesses (visit this page for more information). This issue only
 affects systems running older versions (pre 1.0.0) of openSSL. Newer
 versions explicitly disable SSLv2.
