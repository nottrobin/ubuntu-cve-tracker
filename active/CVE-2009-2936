Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The Command Line Interface (aka Server CLI or administration
 interface) in the master process in the reverse proxy server in Varnish
 before 2.1.0 does not require authentication for commands received through
 a TCP port, which allows remote attackers to (1) execute arbitrary code via
 a vcl.inline directive that provides a VCL configuration file containing
 inline C code; (2) change the ownership of the master process via
 param.set, stop, and start directives; (3) read the initial line of an
 arbitrary file via a vcl.load directive; or (4) conduct cross-site request
 forgery (CSRF) attacks that leverage a victim's location on a trusted
 network and improper input validation of directives.  NOTE: the vendor
 disputes this report, saying that it is "fundamentally misguided and
 pointless."
