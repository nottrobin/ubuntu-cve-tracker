Description:
 Apache Commons HttpClient 3.x, as used in Amazon Flexible Payments Service
 (FPS) merchant Java SDK and other products, does not verify that the server
 hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or
 subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid
 certificate.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> Apache Commons HttpClient has been replaced by HttpComponents
 mdeslaur> debian released 3.1-10.1 with a possible regression
 mdeslaur> Nothing in the main archive seems to be directly affected by
 mdeslaur> this, and changing it now may introduce failures in certain
 mdeslaur> environments where the CN doesn't match the hostname.
 mdeslaur> Downgrading priority to "low"
