Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x allowing x86 HVM guest OS
 users to cause a denial of service (unexpectedly high interrupt number,
 array overrun, and hypervisor crash) or possibly gain hypervisor privileges
 by setting up an HPET timer to deliver interrupts in IO-APIC mode, aka
 vHPET interrupt injection.
