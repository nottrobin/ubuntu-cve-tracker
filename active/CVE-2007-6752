Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Drupal
 7.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of
 arbitrary users for requests that end a session via the user/logout URI.
 NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue, by considering
 the "security benefit against platform complexity and performance impact"
 and concluding that a change to the logout behavior is not planned because
 "for most sites it is not worth the trade-off."
