Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  lxsession-logout in lxsession in LXDE, as used on SUSE
 openSUSE 11.3 and other platforms, does not lock the screen when the
 Suspend or Hibernate button is pressed, which might make it easier for
 physically proximate attackers to access an unattended laptop via a resume
 action.  NOTE: there is no general agreement that this is a vulnerability,
 because separate control over locking can be an equally secure, or more
 secure, behavior in some threat environments.
