Description:
 The SIP channel driver in Asterisk Open Source 1.2.x before 1.2.34, 1.4.x
 before 1.4.26.1, 1.6.0.x before 1.6.0.12, and 1.6.1.x before 1.6.1.4;
 Asterisk Business Edition A.x.x, B.x.x before B.2.5.9, C.2.x before
 C.2.4.1, and C.3.x before C.3.1; and Asterisk Appliance s800i 1.2.x before
 1.3.0.3 does not use a maximum width when invoking sscanf style functions,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack memory
 consumption) via SIP packets containing large sequences of ASCII decimal
 characters, as demonstrated via vectors related to (1) the CSeq value in a
 SIP header, (2) large Content-Length value, and (3) SDP.
