Description:
 Array index error in the uri_lookup function in the URI parser for neon
 0.26.0 to 0.26.2, possibly only on 64-bit platforms, allows remote
 malicious servers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a URI with
 non-ASCII characters, which triggers a buffer under-read due to a type
 conversion error that generates a negative index.
