Description:
 CouchDB administrative users before 2.2.0 can configure the database server
 via HTTP(S). Due to insufficient validation of administrator-supplied
 configuration settings via the HTTP API, it is possible for a CouchDB
 administrator user to escalate their privileges to that of the operating
 system's user under which CouchDB runs, by bypassing the blacklist of
 configuration settings that are not allowed to be modified via the HTTP
 API. This privilege escalation effectively allows a CouchDB admin user to
 gain arbitrary remote code execution, bypassing CVE-2017-12636 and
 CVE-2018-8007.
