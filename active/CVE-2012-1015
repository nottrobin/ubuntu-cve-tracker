Description:
 The kdc_handle_protected_negotiation function in the Key Distribution
 Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.8.x, 1.9.x before 1.9.5, and
 1.10.x before 1.10.3 attempts to calculate a checksum before verifying that
 the key type is appropriate for a checksum, which allows remote attackers
 to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (uninitialized
 pointer free, heap memory corruption, and daemon crash) via a crafted
 AS-REQ request.
