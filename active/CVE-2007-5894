Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  The reply function in ftpd.c in the gssftp ftpd in MIT
 Kerberos 5 (krb5) does not initialize the length variable when auth_type
 has a certain value, which has unknown impact and remote authenticated
 attack vectors.  NOTE: the original disclosure misidentifies the conditions
 under which the uninitialized variable is used.  NOTE: the vendor disputes
 this issue, stating " The 'length' variable is only uninitialized if
 'auth_type' is neither the 'KERBEROS_V4' nor 'GSSAPI'; this condition
 cannot occur in the unmodified source code."
