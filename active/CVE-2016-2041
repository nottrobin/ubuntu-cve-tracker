Description:
 libraries/common.inc.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.13, 4.4.x before
 4.4.15.3, and 4.5.x before 4.5.4 does not use a constant-time algorithm for
 comparing CSRF tokens, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass
 intended access restrictions by measuring time differences.
