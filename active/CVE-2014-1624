Description:
 Race condition in the xdg.BaseDirectory.get_runtime_dir function in
 python-xdg 0.25 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files by
 pre-creating /tmp/pyxdg-runtime-dir-fallback-victim to point to a
 victim-owned location, then replacing it with a symlink to an
 attacker-controlled location once the get_runtime_dir function is called.
