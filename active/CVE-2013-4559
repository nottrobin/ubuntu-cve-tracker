Description:
 lighttpd before 1.4.33 does not check the return value of the (1) setuid,
 (2) setgid, or (3) setgroups functions, which might cause lighttpd to run
 as root if it is restarted and allows remote attackers to gain privileges,
 as demonstrated by multiple calls to the clone function that cause setuid
 to fail when the user process limit is reached.
