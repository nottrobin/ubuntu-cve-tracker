Description:
 A flaw was found in the way the Ceph RGW Beast front-end handles unexpected
 disconnects. An authenticated attacker can abuse this flaw by making
 multiple disconnect attempts resulting in a permanent leak of a socket
 connection by radosgw. This flaw could lead to a denial of service
 condition by pile up of CLOSE_WAIT sockets, eventually leading to the
 exhaustion of available resources, preventing legitimate users from
 connecting to the system.
