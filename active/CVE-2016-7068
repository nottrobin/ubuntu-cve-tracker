Description:
 An issue has been found in PowerDNS before 3.4.11 and 4.0.2, and PowerDNS
 recursor before 3.7.4 and 4.0.4, allowing a remote, unauthenticated
 attacker to cause an abnormal CPU usage load on the PowerDNS server by
 sending crafted DNS queries, which might result in a partial denial of
 service if the system becomes overloaded. This issue is based on the fact
 that the PowerDNS server parses all records present in a query regardless
 of whether they are needed or even legitimate. A specially crafted query
 containing a large number of records can be used to take advantage of that
 behaviour.
