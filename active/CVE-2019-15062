Description:
 An issue was discovered in Dolibarr 11.0.0-alpha. A user can store an
 IFRAME element (containing a user/card.php CSRF request) in his Linked
 Files settings page. When visited by the admin, this could completely take
 over the admin account. (The protection mechanism for CSRF is to check the
 Referer header; however, because the attack is from one of the
 application's own settings pages, this mechanism is bypassed.)
