Description:
 Suricata before 4.0.4 is prone to an HTTP detection bypass vulnerability in
 detect.c and stream-tcp.c. If a malicious server breaks a normal TCP flow
 and sends data before the 3-way handshake is complete, then the data sent
 by the malicious server will be accepted by web clients such as a web
 browser or Linux CLI utilities, but ignored by Suricata IDS signatures.
 This mostly affects IDS signatures for the HTTP protocol and TCP stream
 content; signatures for TCP packets will inspect such network traffic as
 usual.
