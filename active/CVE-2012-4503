Description:
 cmdmon.c in Chrony before 1.29 allows remote attackers to obtain
 potentially sensitive information from stack memory via vectors related to
 (1) an invalid subnet in a RPY_SUBNETS_ACCESSED command to the
 handle_subnets_accessed function or (2) a RPY_CLIENT_ACCESSES command to
 the handle_client_accesses function when client logging is disabled, which
 causes uninitialized data to be included in a reply.
