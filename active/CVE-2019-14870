Description:
 All Samba versions 4.x.x before 4.9.17, 4.10.x before 4.10.11 and 4.11.x
 before 4.11.3 have an issue, where the S4U (MS-SFU) Kerberos delegation
 model includes a feature allowing for a subset of clients to be opted out
 of constrained delegation in any way, either S4U2Self or regular Kerberos
 authentication, by forcing all tickets for these clients to be
 non-forwardable. In AD this is implemented by a user attribute
 delegation_not_allowed (aka not-delegated), which translates to
 disallow-forwardable. However the Samba AD DC does not do that for S4U2Self
 and does set the forwardable flag even if the impersonated client has the
 not-delegated flag set.
