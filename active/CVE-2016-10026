Description:
 ikiwiki 3.20161219 does not properly check if a revision changes the access
 permissions for a page on sites with the git and recentchanges plugins and
 the CGI interface enabled, which allows remote attackers to revert certain
 changes by leveraging permissions to change the page before the revision
 was made.
