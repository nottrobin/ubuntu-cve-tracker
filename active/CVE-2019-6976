 https://github.com/libvips/libvips/releases/tag/v8.7.4
Description:
 libvips before 8.7.4 generates output images from uninitialized memory
 locations when processing corrupted input image data because
 iofuncs/memory.c does not zero out allocated memory. This can result in
 leaking raw process memory contents through the output image.
