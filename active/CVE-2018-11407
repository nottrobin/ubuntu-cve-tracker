Description:
 An issue was discovered in the Ldap component in Symfony 2.8.x before
 2.8.37, 3.3.x before 3.3.17, 3.4.x before 3.4.7, and 4.0.x before 4.0.7. It
 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by logging in with a
 "null" password and valid username, which triggers an unauthenticated bind.
