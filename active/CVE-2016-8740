Description:
 The mod_http2 module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.17 through 2.4.23, when
 the Protocols configuration includes h2 or h2c, does not restrict
 request-header length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (memory consumption) via crafted CONTINUATION frames in an HTTP/2
 request.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> mod_http2 is not built in Ubuntu because it is considered
