Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  Xfce4-session 4.5.91 in Xfce does not lock the screen when
 the suspend or hibernate button is pressed, which might make it easier for
 physically proximate attackers to access an unattended laptop via a resume
 action, a related issue to CVE-2010-2532.  NOTE: there is no general
 agreement that this is a vulnerability, because separate control over
 locking can be an equally secure, or more secure, behavior in some threat
 environments.
