Description:
 An issue was discovered in CHICKEN Scheme through 4.12.0. When using a
 nonstandard CHICKEN-specific extension to allocate an SRFI-4 vector in
 unmanaged memory, the vector size would be used in unsanitised form as an
 argument to malloc(). With an unexpected size, the impact may have been a
 segfault or buffer overflow.
