Description:
 Cacti through 1.2.7 is affected by multiple instances of lib/functions.php
 unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data to populate arrays. An
 authenticated attacker could use this to influence object data values and
 control actions taken by Cacti or potentially cause memory corruption in
 the PHP module.
