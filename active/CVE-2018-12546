Description:
 In Eclipse Mosquitto version 1.0 to 1.5.5 (inclusive) when a client
 publishes a retained message to a topic, then has its access to that topic
 revoked, the retained message will still be published to clients that

 in clients being able cause effects that would otherwise not be allowed.
