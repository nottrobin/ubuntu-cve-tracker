Description:
 Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.4.4 grants ticket access on the
 basis of single-digit substrings of the CustomerID value, which allows
 remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions in
 opportunistic circumstances by visiting a ticket, as demonstrated by
 leveraging the CustomerID 12 account to read tickets that should be
 available only to CustomerID 1 or CustomerID 2.
