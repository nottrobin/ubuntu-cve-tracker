Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** wp-admin/setup-config.php in the installation component in
 WordPress 3.3.1 and earlier does not limit the number of MySQL queries sent
 to external MySQL database servers, which allows remote attackers to use
 WordPress as a proxy for brute-force attacks or denial of service attacks
 via the dbhost parameter, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4898.
 NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue because an
 incomplete WordPress installation might be present on the network for only
 a short time.
