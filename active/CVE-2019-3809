Description:
 A flaw was found in Moodle versions 3.1 to 3.1.15 and earlier unsupported
 versions. The mybackpack functionality allowed setting the URL of badges,
 when it should be restricted to the Mozilla Open Badges backpack URL. This
 resulted in the possibility of blind SSRF via requests made by the page.
