Description:
 The xlu_vif_parse_rate function in the libxlu library in Xen 4.2.x and
 4.3.x allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
 dereference) by using the "@" character as the VIF rate configuration.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> per upstream, "The only known user of this library is the xl
  toolstack which does not have a central long running daemon and therefore the
  impact is limited to crashing the process which is creating the domain, which
  exists only to service a single domain."
 mdeslaur> This is XSA-68
