Description:
 The rb_str_format function in Ruby 1.8.4 and earlier, 1.8.5 before
 1.8.5-p231, 1.8.6 before 1.8.6-p230, 1.8.7 before 1.8.7-p22, and 1.9.0
 before 1.9.0-2 allows context-dependent attackers to trigger memory
 corruption via unspecified vectors related to alloca, a different issue
 than CVE-2008-2662, CVE-2008-2663, and CVE-2008-2725.  NOTE: as of
 20080624, there has been inconsistent usage of multiple CVE identifiers
 related to Ruby. The CVE description should be regarded as authoritative,
 although it is likely to change.
