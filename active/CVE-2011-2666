Description:
 The default configuration of the SIP channel driver in Asterisk Open Source
 1.4.x through 1.4.41.2 and 1.6.2.x through 1.6.2.18.2 does not enable the
 alwaysauthreject option, which allows remote attackers to enumerate account
 names by making a series of invalid SIP requests and observing the
 differences in the responses for different usernames, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2011-2536.
