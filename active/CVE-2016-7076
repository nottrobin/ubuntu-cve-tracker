Description:
 sudo before version 1.8.18p1 is vulnerable to a bypass in the sudo noexec
 restriction if application run via sudo executed wordexp() C library
 function with a user supplied argument. A local user permitted to run such
 application via sudo with noexec restriction could possibly use this flaw
 to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.

Notes:
 sarnold> See also CVE-2016-7032
 sarnold> This alert mentions a seccomp-based filter. If we decide to
  backport that filter for this CVE, and CVE-2016-7032, then 'medium'
  may continue to be appropriate. If we decide the seccomp-based filter
  is not suitable for a backport, then perhaps 'negligible' would be
  appropriate.
