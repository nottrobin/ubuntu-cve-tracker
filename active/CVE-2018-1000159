Description:
 tlslite-ng version 0.7.3 and earlier, since commit
 d7b288316bca7bcdd082e6ccff5491e241305233 contains a CWE-354: Improper
 Validation of Integrity Check Value vulnerability in TLS implementation,
 tlslite/utils/constanttime.py: ct_check_cbc_mac_and_pad(); line "end_pos =
 data_len - 1 - mac.digest_size" that can result in an attacker manipulating
 the TLS ciphertext which will not be detected by receiving tlslite-ng. This
 attack appears to be exploitable via man in the middle on a network
 connection. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed after commit
 3674815d1b0f7484454995e2737a352e0a6a93d8.
