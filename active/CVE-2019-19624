Description:
 An out-of-bounds read was discovered in OpenCV before 4.1.1. Specifically,
 variable coarsest_scale is assumed to be greater than or equal to
 finest_scale within the calc()/ocl_calc() functions in dis_flow.cpp.
 However, this is not true when dealing with small images, leading to an
 out-of-bounds read of the heap-allocated arrays Ux and Uy.
