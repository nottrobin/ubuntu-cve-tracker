Description:
 It was found that the fix for CVE-2016-9606 in versions 3.0.22 and 3.1.2
 was incomplete and Yaml unmarshalling in Resteasy is still possible via
 `Yaml.load()` in YamlProvider.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 msalvatore> Incomplete fix for CVE-2016-9606 not applied. That fix just disables
 msalvatore> the YamlProvider by default. There is no fix for this issue
 msalvatore> other than to mitigate it by requiring authentication and authorization
 msalvatore> on endpoints expecting YAML input.
