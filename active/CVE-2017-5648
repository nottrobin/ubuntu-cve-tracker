Description:
 While investigating bug 60718, it was noticed that some calls to
 application listeners in Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.M17, 8.5.0 to
 8.5.11, 8.0.0.RC1 to 8.0.41, and 7.0.0 to 7.0.75 did not use the
 appropriate facade object. When running an untrusted application under a
 SecurityManager, it was therefore possible for that untrusted application
 to retain a reference to the request or response object and thereby access
 and/or modify information associated with another web application.
