Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** The Wave_read._read_fmt_chunk function in Lib/wave.py in
 Python through 3.6.4 does not ensure a nonzero channel value, which allows
 attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero and exception) via a
 crafted wav format audio file. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue because
 Python applications "need to be prepared to handle a wide variety of
 exceptions."
