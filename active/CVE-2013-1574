Description:
 The dissect_bthci_eir_ad_data function in
 epan/dissectors/packet-bthci_cmd.c in the Bluetooth HCI dissector in
 Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.13 and 1.8.x before 1.8.5 uses an incorrect data
 type for a counter variable, which allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (infinite loop) via a malformed packet.
