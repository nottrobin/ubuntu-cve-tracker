Description:
 When using an OCSP responder Apache Tomcat Native 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and
 1.1.23 to 1.1.34 did not correctly handle invalid responses. This allowed
 for revoked client certificates to be incorrectly identified. It was
 therefore possible for users to authenticate with revoked certificates when
 using mutual TLS. Users not using OCSP checks are not affected by this
 vulnerability.
