Description:
 An exploitable integer overflow exists in the
 'modifier_mdef_compact_influences' functionality of the Blender open-source
 3d creation suite v2.78c. A specially crafted .blend file can cause an
 integer overflow resulting in a buffer overflow which can allow for code
 execution under the context of the application. An attacker can convince a
 user to open a .blend file in order to trigger this vulnerability.
