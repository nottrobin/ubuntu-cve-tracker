 https://hhvm.com/blog/2019/06/10/hhvm-4.9.0.html
Description:
 HHVM, when used with FastCGI, would bind by default to all available
 interfaces. This behavior could allow a malicious individual unintended
 direct access to the application, which could result in information
 disclosure. This issue affects versions 4.3.0, 4.4.0, 4.5.0, 4.6.0, 4.7.0,
 4.8.0, versions 3.30.5 and below, and all versions in the 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2
 series.
