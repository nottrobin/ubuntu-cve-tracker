Description:
 WebKit, as used in Google Chrome before 10.0.648.204 and Apple Safari
 before 5.0.6, does not properly handle node parentage, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (DOM tree corruption), conduct
 cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or possibly have unspecified other
 impact via unknown vectors.
