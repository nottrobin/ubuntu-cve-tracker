Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in nrpe.c in Nagios
 Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE) 2.15 and earlier allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary commands via a newline character in the -a option to
 libexec/check_nrpe.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by multiple parties. It
 has been reported that the vendor allows newlines as "expected behavior."
 Also, this issue can only occur when the administrator enables the
 "dont_blame_nrpe" option in nrpe.conf despite the "HIGH security risk"
 warning within the comments.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> I marked this 'low' because arguments are discouraged for many
  environments, access to NRPE can be restricted with firewalling or
  other user access controls, and this might plausibly be a feature.
