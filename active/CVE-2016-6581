Description:
 A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python HPACK library
 between v1.0.0 and v2.2.0 could be targeted for a denial of service attack,
 specifically a so-called "HPACK Bomb" attack. This attack occurs when an
 attacker inserts a header field that is exactly the size of the HPACK
 dynamic header table into the dynamic header table. The attacker can then
 send a header block that is simply repeated requests to expand that field
 in the dynamic table. This can lead to a gigantic compression ratio of
 4,096 or better, meaning that 16kB of data can decompress to 64MB of data
 on the target machine.
