Description:
 The pam_lsass library in Likewise Open 5.4 and CIFS 5.4 before build 8046,
 and 6.0 before build 8234, uses "SetPassword logic" when running as part of
 a root service, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication for
 a Likewise Security Authority (lsassd) account whose password is marked as
 expired.
Ubuntu-Description: 
 Matt Weatherford discovered that Likewise Open did not correctly check
 password expiration for the local-provider account. A local attacker
 could exploit this to log into a system they would otherwise not have
 access to.
