Description:
 The pe_ILF_object_p function in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library
 (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, is vulnerable to a
 heap-based buffer over-read of size 4049 because it uses the strlen
 function instead of strnlen, leading to program crashes in several
 utilities such as addr2line, size, and strings. It could lead to
 information disclosure as well.
