Description:
 The III_i_stereo function in layer3.c in mpglib, as used in libmpgdecoder.a
 in LAME 3.99.5 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted
 audio file that is mishandled in the code for the "block_type == 2" case, a
 similar issue to CVE-2017-11126.
