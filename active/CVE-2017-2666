Description:
 It was discovered in Undertow that the code that parsed the HTTP request
 line permitted invalid characters. This could be exploited, in conjunction
 with a proxy that also permitted the invalid characters but with a
 different interpretation, to inject data into the HTTP response. By
 manipulating the HTTP response the attacker could poison a web-cache,
 perform an XSS attack, or obtain sensitive information from requests other
 than their own.
