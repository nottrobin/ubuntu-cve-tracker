Description:
 Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Transmission 1.5 before
 1.53 and 1.6 before 1.61 allows remote attackers to hijack the
 authentication of unspecified victims via unknown vectors.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> 8.04 LTS does not provide a web interface
 jdstrand> 9.04 switched http implementations from shttpd to evhttpd. As a
  result, the upstream patch is not valid on 8.10 and a new patch needs to be
  written from scratch. The web interface in 8.10 is considered beta and is
  disabled by default. The web interface must be enabled and the user must
  be tricked into navigating his/her browser to a malicious site while
  transmission is running.
