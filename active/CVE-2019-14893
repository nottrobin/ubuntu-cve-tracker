Description:
 A flaw was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind in all versions before
 2.9.10 and 2.10.0, where it would permit polymorphic deserialization of
 malicious objects using the xalan JNDI gadget when used in conjunction with
 polymorphic type handling methods such as `enableDefaultTyping()` or when
 @JsonTypeInfo is using `Id.CLASS` or `Id.MINIMAL_CLASS` or in any other way
 which ObjectMapper.readValue might instantiate objects from unsafe sources.
 An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code.
