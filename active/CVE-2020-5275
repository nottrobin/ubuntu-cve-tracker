Description:
 In symfony/security-http before versions 4.4.7 and 5.0.7, when a `Firewall`
 checks access control rule, it iterate overs each rule's attributes and
 stops as soon as the accessDecisionManager decides to grant access on the
 attribute, preventing the check of next attributes that should have been
 take into account in an unanimous strategy. The accessDecisionManager is
 now called with all attributes at once, allowing the unanimous strategy
 being applied on each attribute. This issue is patched in versions 4.4.7
 and 5.0.7.
