Description:
 Perdition, the IMAP and POP proxy server, fails to apply the
 administrator's specified ciphersuite preferences when making outbound
 connections to IMAP and POP servers using STARTTLS. For these outbound
 connections, it applies the administrator's listening ciphersuite
 preferences, which in many cases may be significantly weaker.
