Description:
 A missing check on incoming client requests can be exploited to cause a
 situation where the Kea server's lease storage contains leases which are
 rejected as invalid when the server tries to load leases from storage on
 restart. If the number of such leases exceeds a hard-coded limit in the Kea
 code, a server trying to restart will conclude that there is a problem with
 its lease store and give up. Versions affected: 1.4.0 to 1.5.0,
 1.6.0-beta1, and 1.6.0-beta2
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes:
 amurray> This only affects servers which are using memfile for lease
  storage.
