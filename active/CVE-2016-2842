Description:
 The doapr_outch function in crypto/bio/b_print.c in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before
 1.0.1s and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2g does not verify that a certain memory
 allocation succeeds, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
 service (out-of-bounds write or memory consumption) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a long string, as demonstrated by a large
 amount of ASN.1 data, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-0799.
