Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** An issue has been found in HTSlib 1.8. It is a memory leak
 in bgzf_getline in bgzf.c. NOTE: the software maintainer's position is that
 the "failure to free memory" can be fixed in applications that use the
 HTSlib library (such as test/test_bgzf.c in the original report) and is not
 a library issue.
