Description:
 resolv.c in the DNS resolver in uIP, and dns.c in the DNS resolver in lwIP
 1.4.1 and earlier, does not use random values for ID fields and source
 ports of DNS query packets, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle
 attackers to conduct cache-poisoning attacks via spoofed reply packets.
