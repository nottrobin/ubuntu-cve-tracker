Description:
 qemu-nbd in QEMU, as used in Xen 4.2.x, determines the format of a raw disk
 image based on the header, which allows local guest OS administrators to
 read arbitrary files on the host by modifying the header to identify a
 different format, which is used when the guest is restarted, a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2008-2004.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes:
 jdstrand> attack is: privileged attacker in the guest that uses a raw image
  writes data to beginning of device. Later, someone on the host uses qemu-nbd
  on the attacker-modified image. When the guest is rebooted, the attacker may
  have access to other files.
 jdstrand> On Ubuntu, the preferred virtualization management technology is
  libvirt. As of USN-1008-1, libvirt does not probe the disk format, which
  reduces this attack to a denial of server for the guest (ie, the
  attacker-modified image is not usable on reboot).
 jdstrand> TODO: review use in nova
 mdeslaur> patch just introduced new --format option. Default behaviour is
 mdeslaur> still to autodetect. Adding this new option doesn't fix the
 mdeslaur> issue by itself, so marking as "low"
