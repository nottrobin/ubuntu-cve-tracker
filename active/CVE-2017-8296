Description:
 kedpm 0.5 and 1.0 creates a history file in ~/.kedpm/history that is
 written in cleartext. All of the commands performed in the password manager
 are written there. This can lead to the disclosure of the master password
 if the "password" command is used with an argument. The names of the
 password entries created and consulted are also accessible in cleartext.
