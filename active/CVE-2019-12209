Description:
 Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7 attempts parsing of the configured authfile (default
 $HOME/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys) as root (unless openasuser was enabled), and
 does not properly verify that the path lacks symlinks pointing to other
 files on the system owned by root. If the debug option is enabled in the
 PAM configuration, part of the file contents of a symlink target will be
 logged, possibly revealing sensitive information.
