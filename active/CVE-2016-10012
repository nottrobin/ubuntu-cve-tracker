Description:
 The shared memory manager (associated with pre-authentication compression)
 in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 does not ensure that a bounds check is
 enforced by all compilers, which might allows local users to gain
 privileges by leveraging access to a sandboxed privilege-separation
 process, related to the m_zback and m_zlib data structures.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ratliff> Mitigating circumstances noted in the release notes:
 ratliff> This could potentially allow attacks against the
 ratliff> privileged monitor process from the sandboxed privilege-separation
 ratliff> process (a compromise of the latter would be required first).
 ratliff> also "pre-auth compression has been disabled by default in 
 ratliff> sshd for >10 years."
