Description:
 The afs_linux_lock function in afs/LINUX/osi_vnodeops.c in the kernel
 module in OpenAFS 1.4.14, 1.4.12, 1.4.7, and possibly other versions does
 not properly handle errors, which allows attackers to cause a denial of
 service via unknown vectors.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from
 third party information.
