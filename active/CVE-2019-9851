Description:
 LibreOffice is typically bundled with LibreLogo, a programmable turtle
 vector graphics script, which can execute arbitrary python commands
 contained with the document it is launched from. Protection was added, to
 address CVE-2019-9848, to block calling LibreLogo from document event
 script handers, e.g. mouse over. However LibreOffice also has a separate
 feature where documents can specify that pre-installed scripts can be
 executed on various global script events such as document-open, etc. In the
 fixed versions, global script event handlers are validated equivalently to
 document script event handlers. This issue affects: Document Foundation
 LibreOffice versions prior to 6.2.6.
