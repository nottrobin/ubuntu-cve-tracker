Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing ARM guest OS users
 to cause a denial of service via a XENMEM_add_to_physmap hypercall.
 p2m->max_mapped_gfn is used by the functions
 p2m_resolve_translation_fault() and p2m_get_entry() to sanity check guest
 physical frame. The rest of the code in the two functions will assume that
 there is a valid root table and check that with BUG_ON(). The function
 p2m_get_root_pointer() will ignore the unused top bits of a guest physical
 frame. This means that the function p2m_set_entry() will alias the frame.
 However, p2m->max_mapped_gfn will be updated using the original frame. It
 would be possible to set p2m->max_mapped_gfn high enough to cover a frame
 that would lead p2m_get_root_pointer() to return NULL in p2m_get_entry()
 and p2m_resolve_translation_fault(). Additionally, the sanity check on
 p2m->max_mapped_gfn is off-by-one allowing "highest mapped + 1" to be
 considered valid. However, p2m_get_root_pointer() will return NULL. The
 problem could be triggered with a specially crafted hypercall
 XENMEM_add_to_physmap{, _batch} followed by an access to an address (via
 hypercall or direct access) that passes the sanity check but cause
 p2m_get_root_pointer() to return NULL. A malicious guest administrator may
 cause a hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Xen
 version 4.8 and newer are vulnerable. Only Arm systems are vulnerable. x86
 systems are not affected.
