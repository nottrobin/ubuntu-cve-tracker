Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the get_component function in unsquashfs.c
 in unsquashfs in Squashfs 4.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via a crafted list file (aka a crafted file for the
 -ef option).  NOTE: probably in most cases, the list file is a trusted file
 constructed by the program's user; however, there are some realistic
 situations in which a list file would be obtained from an untrusted remote
 source.
