Description:
 Heap-based buffer overflow in the dissector_postgresql function in
 dissectors/ec_postgresql.c in Ettercap before 0.8.1 allows remote attackers
 to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via a
 crafted password length value that is inconsistent with the actual length
 of the password.
