Description:
 Scrapy 1.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
 consumption) via large files because arbitrarily many files are read into
 memory, which is especially problematic if the files are then individually
 written in a separate thread to a slow storage resource, as demonstrated by
 interaction between dataReceived (in core/downloader/handlers/http11.py)
 and S3FilesStore.
