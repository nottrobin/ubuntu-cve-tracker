Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** lib/crypto/c_src/crypto_drv.c in erlang does not properly
 check the return value from the OpenSSL DSA_do_verify function, which might
 allow remote attackers to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a
 malformed SSL/TLS signature, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.
 NOTE: a package maintainer disputes this issue, reporting that there is a
 proper check within the only code that uses the applicable part of
 crypto_drv.c, and thus "this report is invalid."
