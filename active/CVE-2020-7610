 https://github.com/mongodb/js-bson/commit/3809c1313a7b2a8001065f0271199df9fa3d16a8
Description:
 All versions of bson before 1.1.4 are vulnerable to Deserialization of
 Untrusted Data. The package will ignore an unknown value for an object's
 _bsotype, leading to cases where an object is serialized as a document
 rather than the intended BSON type.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> The github patch link from snyk.io shows a diff with
  'serializer.js', but the description is for Deserialization. I don't
  know if this is intentoinal or not.
