Description:
 ownCloud Desktop Client before 1.8.2 does not call
 QNetworkReply::ignoreSslErrors with the list of errors to be ignored, which
 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass the user's certificate
 distrust decision and obtain sensitive information by leveraging a
 self-signed certificate and a connection to a server using its own
 self-signed certificate.
