Description:
 Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) before 2.49 has unsafe implicit
 linking against Version.dll. In other words, there is no protection
 mechanism in which a wrapper function resolves the dependency at an
 appropriate time during runtime.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that NSIS incorrectly handled temporary folders. An attacker
 could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary commands.
