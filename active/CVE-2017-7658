Description:
 In Eclipse Jetty Server, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all non HTTP/1.x
 configurations), and 9.4.x (all HTTP/1.x configurations), when presented
 with two content-lengths headers, Jetty ignored the second. When presented
 with a content-length and a chunked encoding header, the content-length was
 ignored (as per RFC 2616). If an intermediary decided on the shorter
 length, but still passed on the longer body, then body content could be
 interpreted by Jetty as a pipelined request. If the intermediary was
 imposing authorization, the fake pipelined request would bypass that
 authorization.
