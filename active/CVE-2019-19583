Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 HVM/PVH guest OS
 users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) because VMX VMEntry
 checks mishandle a certain case. Please see XSA-260 for background on the
 MovSS shadow. Please see XSA-156 for background on the need for #DB
 interception. The VMX VMEntry checks do not like the exact combination of
 state which occurs when #DB in intercepted, Single Stepping is active, and
 blocked by STI/MovSS is active, despite this being a legitimate state to be
 in. The resulting VMEntry failure is fatal to the guest. HVM/PVH guest
 userspace code may be able to crash the guest, resulting in a guest Denial
 of Service. All versions of Xen are affected. Only systems supporting VMX
 hardware virtual extensions (Intel, Cyrix, or Zhaoxin CPUs) are affected.
 Arm and AMD systems are unaffected. Only HVM/PVH guests are affected. PV
 guests cannot leverage the vulnerability.
