Description:
 Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in http/cervlet.c in Tildeslash Monit
 before 5.25.3 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to introduce
 arbitrary JavaScript via manipulation of an unsanitized user field of the
 Authorization header for HTTP Basic Authentication, which is mishandled
 during an _viewlog operation.
Ubuntu-Description:
 Zack Flack discovered that Monit incorrectly handled certain input. A remote
 authenticated user could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
 attacks.
