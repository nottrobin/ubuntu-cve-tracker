Description:
 Use-after-free vulnerability in Sendmail before 8.13.8 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long "header line",
 which causes a previously freed variable to be referenced. NOTE: the
 original developer has disputed the severity of this issue, saying "The
 only denial of service that is possible here is to fill up the disk with
 core dumps if the OS actually generates different core dumps (which is
 unlikely)... the bug is in the shutdown code (finis()) which leads directly
 to exit(3), i.e., the process would terminate anyway, no mail delivery or
 receiption is affected."
