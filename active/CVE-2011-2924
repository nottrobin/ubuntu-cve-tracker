Description: 
 It was found that foomatic-rip filter used insecurely created temporary
 file for storage of PostScript data by rendering the data, intended to be
 sent to the PostScript filter, when the debug mode was enabled. A local
 attacker could use this flaw to conduct symlink attacks (overwrite
 arbitrary file accessible with the privileges of the user running the
 foomatic-rip universal print filter).
