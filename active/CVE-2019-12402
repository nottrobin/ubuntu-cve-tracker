Description:
 The file name encoding algorithm used internally in Apache Commons Compress
 1.15 to 1.18 can get into an infinite loop when faced with specially
 crafted inputs. This can lead to a denial of service attack if an attacker
 can choose the file names inside of an archive created by Compress.
