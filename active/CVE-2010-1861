Description:
 The sysvshm extension for PHP 5.2 through 5.2.13 and 5.3 through 5.3.2
 allows context-dependent attackers to write to arbitrary memory addresses
 by using an object's __sleep function to interrupt an internal call to the
 shm_put_var function, which triggers access of a freed resource.
