Description:
 The implementations of streams for bz2 and php://output improperly
 implemented their readImpl functions, returning -1 consistently. This
 behavior caused some stream functions, such as stream_get_line, to trigger
 an out-of-bounds read when operating on such malformed streams. The
 implementations were updated to return valid values consistently. This
 affects all supported versions of HHVM (3.30 and 3.27.4 and below).
