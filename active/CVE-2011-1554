Description:
 Off-by-one error in t1lib 5.1.2 and earlier, as used in Xpdf before 3.02pl6
 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (application crash) via a PDF document containing a crafted Type 1 font
 that triggers an invalid memory read, integer overflow, and invalid pointer
 dereference, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-0764.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> xpdf in natty is now built with the poppler engine
 mdeslaur> xpdf in earlier releases seems to use system t1lib
