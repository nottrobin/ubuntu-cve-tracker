Description:
 In WordPress before 4.7.3, there is authenticated Cross-Site Scripting
 (XSS) via Media File Metadata. This is demonstrated by both (1) mishandling
 of the playlist shortcode in the wp_playlist_shortcode function in
 wp-includes/media.php and (2) mishandling of meta information in the
 renderTracks function in wp-includes/js/mediaelement/wp-playlist.js.
