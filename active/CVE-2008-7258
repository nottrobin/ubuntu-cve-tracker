Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  The standardise function in Anibal Monsalve Salazar sSMTP
 2.61 and 2.62 allows local users to cause a denial of service (application
 exit) via an e-mail message containing a long line that begins with a .
 (dot) character.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because it is solely a
 usability problem for senders of messages with certain long lines, and has
 no security impact.
