Description:
 In the default configuration a phpCAS protected application allowed any
 other cas service with proxy authorization and valid user credentials to
 proxy any other phpCAS applications in the same SSO realm.
 This is a security flaw since individual applications should check
 whether another application is actually authorized to proxy for users in
 this particular application.
