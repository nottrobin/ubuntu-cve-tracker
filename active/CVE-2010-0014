Description:
 System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) before 1.0.1, when the krb5
 auth_provider is configured but the KDC is unreachable, allows physically
 proximate attackers to authenticate, via an arbitrary password, to the
 screen-locking program on a workstation that has any user's Kerberos
 ticket-granting ticket (TGT); and might allow remote attackers to bypass
 intended access restrictions via vectors involving an arbitrary password in
 conjunction with a valid TGT.
