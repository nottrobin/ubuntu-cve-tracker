Description:
 A Polymorphic Typing issue was discovered in FasterXML jackson-databind
 2.0.0 through 2.9.10. When Default Typing is enabled (either globally or
 for a specific property) for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and the
 service has the p6spy (3.8.6) jar in the classpath, and an attacker can
 find an RMI service endpoint to access, it is possible to make the service
 execute a malicious payload. This issue exists because of
 com.p6spy.engine.spy.P6DataSource mishandling.
