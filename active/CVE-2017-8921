Description:
 In FlightGear before 2017.2.1, the FGCommand interface allows overwriting
 any file the user has write access to, but not with arbitrary data: only
 with the contents of a FlightGear flightplan (XML). A resource such as a
 malicious third-party aircraft could exploit this to damage files belonging
 to the user. Both this issue and CVE-2016-9956 are directory traversal
 vulnerabilities in Autopilot/route_mgr.cxx - this one exists because of an
 incomplete fix for CVE-2016-9956.
