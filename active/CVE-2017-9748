Description:
 The ieee_object_p function in bfd/ieee.c in the Binary File Descriptor
 (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, might
 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and
 application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted
 binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during "objdump
 -D" execution. NOTE: this may be related to a compiler bug.
