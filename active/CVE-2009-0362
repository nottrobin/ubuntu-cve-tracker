Description:
 filter.d/wuftpd.conf in Fail2ban 0.8.3 uses an incorrect regular expression
 that allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (forced
 authentication failures) via a crafted reverse-resolved DNS name (rhost)
 entry that contains a substring that is interpreted as an IP address, a
 different vulnerability than CVE-2007-4321.
