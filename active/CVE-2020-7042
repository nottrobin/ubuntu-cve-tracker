Description:
 An issue was discovered in openfortivpn 1.11.0 when used with OpenSSL 1.0.2
 or later. tunnel.c mishandles certificate validation because the hostname
 check operates on uninitialized memory. The outcome is that a valid
 certificate is never accepted (only a malformed certificate may be
 accepted).
