Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE product of Oracle Java SE (component:
 Hotspot). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 11.0.4 and 13.
 Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with
 network access via multiple protocols to compromise Java SE. Successful
 attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized read access to a
 subset of Java SE accessible data and unauthorized ability to cause a
 partial denial of service (partial DOS) of Java SE. Note: This
 vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running
 sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in Java SE
 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the
 internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
 does not apply to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run
 only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base
 Score 4.8 (Confidentiality and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L).
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that the String class in OpenJDK contained an
 out-of-bounds access vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause
 a denial of service (application crash) or possibly expose sensitive
 information.
