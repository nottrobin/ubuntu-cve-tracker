Description:
 Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the wp_check_filetype function in
 wp-includes/functions.php in WordPress before 2.8.6, when a certain
 configuration of the mod_mime module in the Apache HTTP Server is enabled,
 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by posting an
 attachment with a multiple-extension filename, and then accessing this
 attachment via a direct request to a wp-content/uploads/ pathname, as
 demonstrated by a .php.jpg filename.
