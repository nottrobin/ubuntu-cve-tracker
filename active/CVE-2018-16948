Description:
 An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2.
 Several RPC server routines did not fully initialize their output variables
 before returning, leaking memory contents from both the stack and the heap.
 Because the OpenAFS cache manager functions as an Rx server for the AFSCB
 service, clients are also susceptible to information leakage. For example,
 RXAFSCB_TellMeAboutYourself leaks kernel memory and KAM_ListEntry leaks
 kaserver memory.
