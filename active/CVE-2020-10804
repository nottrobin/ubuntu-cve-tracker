Description:
 In phpMyAdmin 4.x before 4.9.5 and 5.x before 5.0.2, a SQL injection
 vulnerability was found in retrieval of the current username (in
 libraries/classes/Server/Privileges.php and
 libraries/classes/UserPassword.php). A malicious user with access to the
 server could create a crafted username, and then trick the victim into
 performing specific actions with that user account (such as editing its
 privileges).
