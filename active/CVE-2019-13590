Description:
 An issue was discovered in libsox.a in SoX 14.4.2. In sox-fmt.h (startread
 function), there is an integer overflow on the result of integer addition
 (wraparound to 0) fed into the lsx_calloc macro that wraps malloc. When a
 NULL pointer is returned, it is used without a prior check that it is a
 valid pointer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference on lsx_readbuf in
 formats_i.c.
