Description:
 WordPress 2.6.3 relies on the REQUEST superglobal array in certain
 dangerous situations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct
 delayed and persistent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks via
 crafted cookies, as demonstrated by attacks that (1) delete user accounts
 or (2) cause a denial of service (loss of application access).  NOTE: this
 issue relies on the presence of an independent vulnerability that allows
 cookie injection.
