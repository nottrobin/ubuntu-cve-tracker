Description:
 Normally in OpenSSL EC groups always have a co-factor present and this is
 used in side channel resistant code paths. However, in some cases, it is
 possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a
 named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have
 the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a
 known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to
 non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery
 during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker
 would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of
 signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use
 by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not
 vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL
 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected
 1.1.0-1.1.0k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2t (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2s).
