Description:
 The http_payload_subdissector function in epan/dissectors/packet-http.c in
 the HTTP dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.16 and 1.8.x before 1.8.8
 does not properly determine when to use a recursive approach, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption) via a
 crafted packet.
