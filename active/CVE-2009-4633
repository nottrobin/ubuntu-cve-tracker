Description:
 vorbis_dec.c in FFmpeg 0.5 uses an assignment operator when a comparison
 operator was intended, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted file that
 modifies a loop counter and triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
