Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.9.x. Grant copying code made an
 implication that any grant pin would be accompanied by a suitable page
 reference. Other portions of code, however, did not match up with that
 assumption. When such a grant copy operation is being done on a grant of a
 dying domain, the assumption turns out wrong. A malicious guest
 administrator can cause hypervisor memory corruption, most likely resulting
 in host crash and a Denial of Service. Privilege escalation and information
 leaks cannot be ruled out.
