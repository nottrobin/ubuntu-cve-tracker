Description:
 Apache Tomcat 7.x through 7.0.70 and 8.x through 8.5.4, when the CGI
 Servlet is enabled, follows RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 and therefore does not
 protect applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the
 HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to
 redirect an application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy
 server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an "httpoxy"
 issue. NOTE: the vendor states "A mitigation is planned for future releases
 of Tomcat, tracked as CVE-2016-5388"; in other words, this is not a CVE ID
 for a vulnerability.
