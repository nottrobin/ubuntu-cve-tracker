Description:
 Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in action_power.py in Cobbler 2.2.0
 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell
 metacharacters in the (1) username or (2) password fields to the
 power_system method in the xmlrpc API.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> maas-provision in 12.04 is a code copy of cobbler, but with reduced
  features and usage. Only the portions of maas-provision specifically used by
  maas will recieve official support
 jdstrand> maas in 12.10 as of 0.1+bzr971+dfsg-0ubuntu1 no longer depends on
  maas-provision and maas-provision has moved to universe. 12.04 should also
  receive this update for maas, so deferring for now.
 jdstrand> maas-provision removed from 12.10 before release
 jdstrand> power functionality is blocked by the AppArmor profile in
  maas-provision on 12.04 LTS, so this vulnerability is mitigated. This was
  tested by modifying /usr/share/pyshared/cobbler/utils.py to remove the check
  for invalid characters, then getting a system name with 'sudo cobbler list'
  then doing something like:
  $ sudo cobbler system edit --name node-457f02f2-3fe6-11e2-a048-525400209fb8 \
    --power-type ether_wake \
    --power-user Admin --power-pass PASSWORD \
    --power-address 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF" ; /usr/bin/touch /gotcha ; "'
  $ sudo cobbler system poweron --name=node-457f02f2-3fe6-11e2-a048-525400209fb8
