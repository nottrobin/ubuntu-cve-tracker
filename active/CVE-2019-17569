Description:
 The refactoring present in Apache Tomcat 9.0.28 to 9.0.30, 8.5.48 to 8.5.50
 and 7.0.98 to 7.0.99 introduced a regression. The result of the regression
 was that invalid Transfer-Encoding headers were incorrectly processed
 leading to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located
 behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid
 Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is
 considered unlikely.
