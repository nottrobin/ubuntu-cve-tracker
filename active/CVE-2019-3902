Description:
 A flaw was found in Mercurial before 4.9. It was possible to use symlinks
 and subrepositories to defeat Mercurial's path-checking logic and write
 files outside a repository.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that Mercurial mishandled symlinks in subrepositories. An
 attacker could use this vulnerability to write arbitrary files to the target's
 filesystem.
