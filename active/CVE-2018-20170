Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** OpenStack Keystone through 14.0.1 has a user enumeration
 vulnerability because invalid usernames have much faster responses than
 valid ones for a POST /v3/auth/tokens request. NOTE: the vendor's position
 is that this is a hardening opportunity, and not necessarily an issue that
 should have an OpenStack Security Advisory.
