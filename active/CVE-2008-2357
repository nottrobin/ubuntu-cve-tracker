Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in the split_redraw function in split.c in mtr
 before 0.73, when invoked with the -p (aka --split) option, allows remote
 attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS PTR record.  NOTE: it
 could be argued that this is a vulnerability in the ns_name_ntop function
 in resolv/ns_name.c in glibc and the proper fix should be in glibc; if so,
 then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in mtr.
