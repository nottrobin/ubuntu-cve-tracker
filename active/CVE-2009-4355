Description:
 Memory leak in the zlib_stateful_finish function in crypto/comp/c_zlib.c in
 OpenSSL 0.9.8l and earlier and 1.0.0 Beta through Beta 4 allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via vectors
 that trigger incorrect calls to the CRYPTO_free_all_ex_data function, as
 demonstrated by use of SSLv3 and PHP with the Apache HTTP Server, a related
 issue to CVE-2008-1678.
