Description:
 Yubico libu2f-host 1.1.6 contains unchecked buffers in devs.c, which could
 enable a malicious token to exploit a buffer overflow. An attacker could
 use this to attempt to execute malicious code using a crafted USB device
 masquerading as a security token on a computer where the affected library
 is currently in use. It is not possible to perform this attack with a
 genuine YubiKey.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 sbeattie> requires libpam-u2f setup or other yubikey based software
