Description:
 Buffer overflow in the ReadImage function in generic/tkImgGIF.c in Tcl
 (Tcl/Tk) 8.4.13 through 8.4.15 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary
 code via multi-frame interlaced GIF files in which later frames are smaller
 than the first.  NOTE: this issue is due to an incorrect patch for
 CVE-2007-5378.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> CVE only affects feisty and gutsy tk8.4.  These releases have a fix
   for tcl/tk bug #1458234, which either introduced or unmasked the issue in
   this CVE (investigate). Bug #1458234 is a memory corruption crasher as well,
   and though it doesn't have a CVE, it should be fixed. tk8.3 is affected by
   #1458234 in all releases, so when fixing it, be sure to fix the CVE as well.
   tk8.4 in dapper and edgy need both fixes too.
