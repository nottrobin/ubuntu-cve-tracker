Description:
 In the coff_pointerize_aux function in coffgen.c in the Binary File
 Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.30,
 an index is not validated, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial
 of service (segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact
 via a crafted file, as demonstrated by objcopy of a COFF object.
