Description:
 The nfs_addmntent function in support/nfs/nfs_mntent.c in the mount.nsf
 tool in nfs-utils before 1.2.4 attempts to append to the /etc/mtab file
 without first checking whether resource limits would interfere, which
 allows local users to corrupt this file via a process with a small
 RLIMIT_FSIZE value, a related issue to CVE-2011-1089.
