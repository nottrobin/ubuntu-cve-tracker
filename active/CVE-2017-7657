Description:
 In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and
 9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled),
 transfer-encoding chunks are handled poorly. The chunk length parsing was
 vulnerable to an integer overflow. Thus a large chunk size could be
 interpreted as a smaller chunk size and content sent as chunk body could be
 interpreted as a pipelined request. If Jetty was deployed behind an
 intermediary that imposed some authorization and that intermediary allowed
 arbitrarily large chunks to be passed on unchanged, then this flaw could be
 used to bypass the authorization imposed by the intermediary as the fake
 pipelined request would not be interpreted by the intermediary as a
 request.
