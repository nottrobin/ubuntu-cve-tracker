Description:
 The core_grade component in Moodle through 2.2.10, 2.3.x before 2.3.7, and
 2.4.x before 2.4.4 does not properly consider the existence of hidden
 grades, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive
 information by leveraging the student role and reading the Gradebook
 Overview report.
