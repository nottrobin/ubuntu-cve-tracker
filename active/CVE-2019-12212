Description:
 When FreeImage 3.18.0 reads a special JXR file, the StreamCalcIFDSize
 function of JXRMeta.c repeatedly calls itself due to improper processing of
 the file, eventually causing stack exhaustion. An attacker can achieve a
 remote denial of service attack by sending a specially constructed file.
