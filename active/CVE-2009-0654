Description:
 Tor 0.2.0.28, and probably 0.2.0.34 and earlier, allows remote attackers,
 with control of an entry router and an exit router, to confirm that a
 sender and receiver are communicating via vectors involving (1) replaying,
 (2) modifying, (3) inserting, or (4) deleting a single cell, and then
 observing cell recognition errors at the exit router.  NOTE: the vendor
 disputes the significance of this issue, noting that the product's design
 "accepted end-to-end correlation as an attack that is too expensive to
 solve."
