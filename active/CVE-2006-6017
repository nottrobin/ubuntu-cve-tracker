Description:
 WordPress before 2.0.5 does not properly store a profile containing a
 string representation of a serialized object, which allows remote
 authenticated users to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a
 string that represents a (1) malformed or (2) large serialized object,
 because the object triggers automatic unserialization for display.
