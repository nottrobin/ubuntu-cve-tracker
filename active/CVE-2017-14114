Description:
 RTPproxy through 2.2.alpha.20160822 has a NAT feature that results in not
 properly determining the IP address and port number of the legitimate
 recipient of RTP traffic, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information or cause a denial of service (communication outage) via crafted
 RTP packets.
