Description:
 PhantomJS through 2.1.1 has an arbitrary file read vulnerability, as
 demonstrated by an XMLHttpRequest for a file:// URI. The vulnerability
 exists in the page.open() function of the webpage module, which loads a
 specified URL and calls a given callback. An attacker can supply a
 specially crafted HTML file, as user input, that allows reading arbitrary
 files on the filesystem. For example, if page.render() is the function
 callback, this generates a PDF or an image of the targeted file. NOTE: this
 product is no longer developed.
