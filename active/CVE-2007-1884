Candidate: CVE-2007-1884
References: 
Description:
 Multiple integer signedness errors in the printf function family in PHP 4
 before 4.4.5 and PHP 5 before 5.2.1 on 64 bit machines allow
 context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) certain
 negative argument numbers that arise in the php_formatted_print function
 because of 64 to 32 bit truncation, and bypass a check for the maximum
 allowable value; and (2) a width and precision of -1, which make it
 possible for the php_sprintf_appendstring function to place an internal
 buffer at an arbitrary memory location.
