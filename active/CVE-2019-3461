Description:
 Debian tmpreaper version 1.6.13+nmu1 has a race condition when doing a
 (bind) mount via rename() which could result in local privilege escalation.
 Mounting via rename() could potentially lead to a file being placed
 elsewhereon the filesystem hierarchy (e.g. /etc/cron.d/) if the directory
 being cleaned up was on the same physical filesystem. Fixed versions
 include 1.6.13+nmu1+deb9u1 and 1.6.14.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ebarretto> Version on trusty needs the fix, but the fix depends on bind mounts
 ebarretto> from util-linux package. And the util-linux in trusty doesn't
 ebarretto> contain that feature. We could use another solution but I am not
 ebarretto> sure how this might affect the race condition.
