Description:
 Google Chrome before 28.0.1500.71 does not properly determine the
 circumstances in which a renderer process can be considered a trusted
 process for sign-in and subsequent sync operations, which makes it easier
 for remote attackers to conduct phishing attacks via a crafted web site.
