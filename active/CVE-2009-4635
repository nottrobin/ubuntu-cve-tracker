 http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-931-1
Description:
 FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and
 possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted MOV container with improperly
 ordered tags that cause (1) mov.c and (2) utils.c to use inconsistent codec
 types and identifiers, which causes the mp3 decoder to process a pointer
 for a video structure, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 kees> stack-protected on Edgy and later, just a DoS
 mdeslaur> This is issue #22
 mdeslaur> The patch for this issue has not been commited by upstream
 mdeslaur> into the 5.x branch. I could not reproduce the issue with
 mdeslaur> 5.x and the google reproducer. The patch included in usn-931-1
 mdeslaur> caused a regression, so was removed in usn-931-2.
