Description:
 An issue was discovered in the ROS communications-related packages (aka
 ros_comm or ros-melodic-ros-comm) through 1.14.3. ROS_ASSERT_MSG only works
 when ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED is defined. This leads to a problem in the remove()
 function in clients/roscpp/src/libros/spinner.cpp. When ROS_ASSERT_ENABLED
 is not defined, the iterator loop will run out of the scope of the array,
 and cause denial of service for other components (that depend on the
 communication-related functions of this package). NOTE: The reporter of
 this issue now believes it was a false alarm.
