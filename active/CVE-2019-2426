Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE component of Oracle Java SE (subcomponent:
 Networking). Supported versions that are affected are Java SE: 7u201, 8u192
 and 11.0.1; Java SE Embedded: 8u191. Difficult to exploit vulnerability
 allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols
 to compromise Java SE. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result
 in unauthorized read access to a subset of Java SE accessible data. Note:
 This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, typically in clients
 running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets (in
 Java SE 8), that load and run untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from
 the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability
 can also be exploited by using APIs in the specified Component, e.g.,
 through a web service which supplies data to the APIs. CVSS 3.0 Base Score
