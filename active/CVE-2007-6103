Description:
 I Hear U (IHU) 0.5.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause (1) a
 denial of service (infinite loop) via a packet that contains zero in the
 size field in its header, which is improperly handled by the
 Receiver::processPacket function; and (2) a denial of service (daemon
 crash) via an (a) IHU_INFO_INIT or a (b) IHU_INFO_RING packet that does not
 specify the mode, which is improperly handled by the Player::ring function
 in Player.cpp.
