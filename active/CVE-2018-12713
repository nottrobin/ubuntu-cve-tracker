Description:
 GIMP through 2.10.2 makes g_get_tmp_dir calls to establish temporary
 filenames, which may result in a filename that already exists, as
 demonstrated by the gimp_write_and_read_file function in
 app/tests/test-xcf.c. This might be leveraged by attackers to overwrite
 files or read file content that was intended to be private.
