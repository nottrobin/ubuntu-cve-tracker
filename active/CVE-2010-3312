Description:
 Epiphany 2.28 and 2.29, when WebKit and LibSoup are used, unconditionally
 displays a closed-lock icon for any URL beginning with the https:
 substring, without any warning to the user, which allows man-in-the-middle
 attackers to spoof arbitrary https web sites via a crafted X.509 server
 certificate.
