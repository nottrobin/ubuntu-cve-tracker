Description:
 Django 2.1 before 2.1.15 and 2.2 before 2.2.8 allows unintended model
 editing. A Django model admin displaying inline related models, where the
 user has view-only permissions to a parent model but edit permissions to
 the inline model, would be presented with an editing UI, allowing POST
 requests, for updating the inline model. Directly editing the view-only
 parent model was not possible, but the parent model's save() method was
 called, triggering potential side effects, and causing pre and post-save
 signal handlers to be invoked. (To resolve this, the Django admin is
 adjusted to require edit permissions on the parent model in order for
 inline models to be editable.)
