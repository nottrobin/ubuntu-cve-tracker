Description:
 Percona Toolkit 2.1 introduced --version-check to warn user about
 known vulnerabilities in the local MySQL instance and to check for PT
 updates. The configuration for what information PT tools should collect
 is not hardcoded in the scripts. Instead, every time it's downloaded from
 http://v.percona.com/. One of the possible parameters is a binary file
 name to be executed, i.e. Percona can remotely execute arbitrary command.
 --version-check is on by default.
