Description:
 When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when
 trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP
 connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP
 connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be
 exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to
 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP
 Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses.
 It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector
 would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a
 mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the
 web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP
 Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files
 within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content
 of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the
 ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It
 is important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is
 accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-depth
 approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary files and
 execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or
 later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP Connector
 configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration. It is likely
 that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or later will need to
 make small changes to their configurations.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 mdeslaur> In Ubuntu packages, the AJP connector is disabled by default,
 mdeslaur> so unless specifically enabled by an admin, deployments made
 mdeslaur> using the package are not vulnerable to this issue.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> Marking this CVE as "low" priority, as even though the AJP
 mdeslaur> connector is disabled, it is desirable to include the hardening
 mdeslaur> patches in a future security update for environments where the
 mdeslaur> connector has been manually enabled.
