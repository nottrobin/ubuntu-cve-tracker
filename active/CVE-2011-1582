Description:
 Apache Tomcat 7.0.12 and 7.0.13 processes the first request to a servlet
 without following security constraints that have been configured through
 annotations, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
 restrictions via HTTP requests.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of
 an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-1088, CVE-2011-1183, and CVE-2011-1419.
