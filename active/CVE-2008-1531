Description:
 The connection_state_machine function (connections.c) in lighttpd 1.4.19
 and earlier, and 1.5.x before 1.5.0, allows remote attackers to cause a
 denial of service (active SSL connection loss) by triggering an SSL error,
 such as disconnecting before a download has finished, which causes all
 active SSL connections to be lost.
