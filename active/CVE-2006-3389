Description:
 index.php in WordPress 2.0.3 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive
 information, such as SQL table prefixes, via an invalid paged parameter,
 which displays the information in an SQL error message.  NOTE: this issue
 has been disputed by a third party who states that the issue does not leak
 any target-specific information.
