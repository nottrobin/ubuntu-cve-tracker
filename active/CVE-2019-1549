Description:
 OpenSSL 1.1.1 introduced a rewritten random number generator (RNG). This
 was intended to include protection in the event of a fork() system call in
 order to ensure that the parent and child processes did not share the same
 RNG state. However this protection was not being used in the default case.
 A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high
 precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent
 and child process sharing state is significantly reduced. If an application
 already calls OPENSSL_init_crypto() explicitly using OPENSSL_INIT_ATFORK
 then this problem does not occur at all. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected
 1.1.1-1.1.1c).
