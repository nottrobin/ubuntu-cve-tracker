Description:
 Vulnerability in the Java SE, Java SE Embedded component of Oracle Java SE
 (subcomponent: Libraries). The supported version that is affected is Java
 SE: 8u131; Java SE Embedded: 8u131. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows
 unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
 compromise Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Successful attacks require human
 interaction from a person other than the attacker and while the
 vulnerability is in Java SE, Java SE Embedded, attacks may significantly
 impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can
 result in takeover of Java SE, Java SE Embedded. Note: This vulnerability
 applies to Java deployments, typically in clients running sandboxed Java
 Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run
 untrusted code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the
 Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply to Java
 deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code
 (e.g., code installed by an administrator). CVSS 3.0 Base Score 9.6
 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS Vector:
 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H).
Ubuntu-Description:
 Jackson Davis discovered that the LambdaFormEditor class in the
 Libraries component of OpenJDK did not correctly perform bounds checks
 in the permuteArgumentsForm() function. An attacker could use this
 to specially construct an untrusted Java application or applet that
 could escape sandbox restrictions and possibly execute arbitrary code.
