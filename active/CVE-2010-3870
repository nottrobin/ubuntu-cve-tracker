Description:
 The utf8_decode function in PHP before 5.3.4 does not properly handle
 non-shortest form UTF-8 encoding and ill-formed subsequences in UTF-8 data,
 which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass cross-site scripting
 (XSS) and SQL injection protection mechanisms via a crafted string.
