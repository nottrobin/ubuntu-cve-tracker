Description:
 The map_yp_alias function in functions/imap_general.php in SquirrelMail
 before 1.4.19-1 on Debian GNU/Linux, and possibly other operating systems
 and versions, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via
 shell metacharacters in a username string that is used by the ypmatch
 program.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2009-1579.
