Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** In the GD Graphics Library (aka LibGD) through 2.2.5, there
 is a heap-based buffer over-read in tiffWriter in gd_tiff.c. NOTE: the
 vendor says "In my opinion this issue should not have a CVE, since the GD
 and GD2 formats are documented to be 'obsolete, and should only be used for
 development and testing purposes.'"
