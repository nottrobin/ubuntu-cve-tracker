Description:
 Versions of the npm CLI prior to 6.13.3 are vulnerable to an Arbitrary File
 Write. It is possible for packages to create symlinks to files outside of
 thenode_modules folder through the bin field upon installation. A properly
 constructed entry in the package.json bin field would allow a package
 publisher to create a symlink pointing to arbitrary files on a user’s
 system when the package is installed. This behavior is still possible
 through install scripts. This vulnerability bypasses a user using the
 --ignore-scripts install option.
