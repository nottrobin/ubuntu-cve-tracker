Description: 
 It was found that libvirt did not explicitly set the user defined backing
 store format when creating new image. This results in images being created
 with an potentialy insecure configuration, preventing applications from
 opening backing stores without resorting to probing. A priviledged guest user
 could use this flaw to access arbitrary files on the host.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 jdstrand> AppArmor in Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04 should protect the host OS, but
  an attacker in a virtual machine may be able to access files of another
  machine.
 jdstrand> Ubuntu 9.10's qemu-img and kvm-img both support '-F backingType', so
  hard code libvirt to use this
 jdstrand> Ubuntu 9.04's qemu-img and kvm-img do not support specifiying a
  backing store disk format, so we must autoprobe backing stores at this time.
  Qemu didn't gain this option until 0.11, and 9.04 has 0.10 and kvm 84. The
  changes to qemu/kvm are too invasive and regression-prone and therefore
  an update will not be provided for this CVE for Ubuntu 9.04.
