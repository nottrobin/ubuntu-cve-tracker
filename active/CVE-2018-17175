Description:
 In the marshmallow library before 2.15.1 and 3.x before 3.0.0b9 for Python,
 the schema "only" option treats an empty list as implying no "only" option,
 which allows a request that was intended to expose no fields to instead
 expose all fields (if the schema is being filtered dynamically using the
 "only" option, and there is a user role that produces an empty value for
 "only").
