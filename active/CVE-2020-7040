Description:
 storeBackup.pl in storeBackup through 3.5 relies on the
 /tmp/storeBackup.lock pathname, which allows symlink attacks that possibly
 lead to privilege escalation. (Local users can also create a plain file
 named /tmp/storeBackup.lock to block use of storeBackup until an admin
 manually deletes that file.)
