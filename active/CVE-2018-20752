Description:
 An issue was discovered in Recon-ng before 4.9.5. Lack of validation in the
 modules/reporting/csv.py file allows CSV injection. More specifically, when
 a Twitter user possesses an Excel macro for a username, it will not be
 properly sanitized when exported to a CSV file. This can result in remote
 code execution for the attacker.
