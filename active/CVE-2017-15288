Description:
 The compilation daemon in Scala before 2.10.7, 2.11.x before 2.11.12, and
 2.12.x before 2.12.4 uses weak permissions for private files in
 /tmp/scala-devel/${USER:shared}/scalac-compile-server-port, which allows
 local users to write to arbitrary class files and consequently gain
 privileges.
