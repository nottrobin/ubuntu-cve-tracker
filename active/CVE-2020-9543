 OpenStack Manila <7.4.1, >=8.0.0 <8.1.1, and >=9.0.0 <9.1.1 allows
 attackers to view, update, delete, or share resources that do not belong to
 them, because of a context-free lookup of a UUID. Attackers may also create
 resources, such as shared file systems and groups of shares on such share
 networks.
