Description:
 A flaw was found in IPA, all 4.6.x versions before 4.6.7, all 4.7.x
 versions before 4.7.4 and all 4.8.x versions before 4.8.3, in the way that
 FreeIPA's batch processing API logged operations. This included passing
 user passwords in clear text on FreeIPA masters. Batch processing of
 commands with passwords as arguments or options is not performed by default
 in FreeIPA but is possible by third-party components. An attacker having
 access to system logs on FreeIPA masters could use this flaw to produce log
 file content with passwords exposed.
