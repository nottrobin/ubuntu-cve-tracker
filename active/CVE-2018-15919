 Remotely observable behaviour in auth-gss2.c in OpenSSH through 7.8 could
 be used by remote attackers to detect existence of users on a target system

 OpenSSH developers do not want to treat such a username enumeration (or
 "oracle") as a vulnerability.'

  cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
  support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.
