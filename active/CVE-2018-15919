Description:
 Remotely observable behaviour in auth-gss2.c in OpenSSH through 7.8 could
 be used by remote attackers to detect existence of users on a target system
 when GSS2 is in use. NOTE: the discoverer states 'We understand that the
 OpenSSH developers do not want to treat such a username enumeration (or
 "oracle") as a vulnerability.'
