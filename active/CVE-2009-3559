Description:
 ** DISPUTED **  main/streams/plain_wrapper.c in PHP 5.3.x before 5.3.1 does
 not recognize the safe_mode_include_dir directive, which allows
 context-dependent attackers to have an unknown impact by triggering the
 failure of PHP scripts that perform include or require operations, as
 demonstrated by a script that attempts to perform a require_once on a file
 in a standard library directory.  NOTE: a reliable third party reports that
 this is not a vulnerability, because it results in a more restrictive
 security policy.
