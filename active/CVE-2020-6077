Description:
 An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the
 message-parsing functionality of Videolabs libmicrodns 0.1.0. When parsing
 mDNS messages, the implementation does not properly keep track of the
 available data in the message, possibly leading to an out-of-bounds read
 that would result in a denial of service. An attacker can send an mDNS
 message to trigger this vulnerability.
