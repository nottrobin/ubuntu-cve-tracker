Description:
 The NIST SP 800-90A default statement of the Dual Elliptic Curve
 Deterministic Random Bit Generation (Dual_EC_DRBG) algorithm contains point
 Q constants with a possible relationship to certain "skeleton key" values,
 which might allow context-dependent attackers to defeat cryptographic
 protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of those values.  NOTE: this
 is a preliminary CVE for Dual_EC_DRBG; future research may provide
 additional details about point Q and associated attacks, and could
 potentially lead to a RECAST or REJECT of this CVE.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> Dual_EC_DRBG has been under suspicion long enough that I suspect
  none of our libraries use it by default, though some may make it available
  for legacy compatability. It might be worthwhile to remove it entirely, so
  that unsafe mechanisms aren't available to provide a false sense of safety.
 mdeslaur> openssl only seems to have Dual_EC_DRBG in the fips module, not
 mdeslaur> in the regular source.
