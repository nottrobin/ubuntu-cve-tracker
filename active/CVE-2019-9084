Description:
 In Hoteldruid before 2.3.1, a division by zero was discovered in
 $num_tabelle in tab_tariffe.php (aka the numtariffa1 parameter) due to the
 mishandling of non-numeric values, as demonstrated by the
 /tab_tariffe.php?anno=[YEAR]&numtariffa1=1a URI. It could allow an
 administrator to conduct remote denial of service (disrupting certain
 business functions of the product).
