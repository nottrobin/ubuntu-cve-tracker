Description:
 The Internet Key Exchange v1 main mode is vulnerable to offline dictionary
 or brute force attacks. Reusing a key pair across different versions and
 modes of IKE could lead to cross-protocol authentication bypasses. It is
 well known, that the aggressive mode of IKEv1 PSK is vulnerable to offline
 dictionary or brute force attacks. For the main mode, however, only an
 online attack against PSK authentication was thought to be feasible. This
 vulnerability could allow an attacker to recover a weak Pre-Shared Key or
 enable the impersonation of a victim host or network.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ebarretto> vulnerability in IKEv1 protocol, not fixable in implementation
