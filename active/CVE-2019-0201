 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1392
Description:
 An issue is present in Apache ZooKeeper 1.0.0 to 3.4.13 and 3.5.0-alpha to
 3.5.4-beta. ZooKeeper?s getACL() command doesn?t check any permission when
 retrieves the ACLs of the requested node and returns all information
 contained in the ACL Id field as plaintext string.
 DigestAuthenticationProvider overloads the Id field with the hash value
 that is used for user authentication. As a consequence, if Digest
 Authentication is in use, the unsalted hash value will be disclosed by
 getACL() request for unauthenticated or unprivileged users.
