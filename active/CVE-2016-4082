Description:
 epan/dissectors/packet-gsm_cbch.c in the GSM CBCH dissector in Wireshark
 1.12.x before 1.12.11 and 2.0.x before 2.0.3 uses the wrong variable to
 index an array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (out-of-bounds access and application crash) via a crafted packet.
