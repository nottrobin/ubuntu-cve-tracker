Description:
 A deserialization flaw was discovered in the jackson-databind in versions
 before 2.8.10 and 2.9.1, which could allow an unauthenticated user to
 perform code execution by sending the maliciously crafted input to the
 readValue method of the ObjectMapper. This issue extends the previous flaw
 CVE-2017-7525 by blacklisting more classes that could be used maliciously.
