Description:
 The privilege-dropping implementation in the (1) pam_env and (2) pam_mail
 modules in Linux-PAM (aka pam) 1.1.2 does not check the return value of the
 setfsuid system call, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive
 information by leveraging an unintended uid, as demonstrated by a symlink
 attack on the .pam_environment file in a user's home directory.  NOTE: this
 vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2010-3435.
