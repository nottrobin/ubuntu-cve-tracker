Description:
 An exploitable integer overflow exists in the Image loading functionality
 of the Blender open-source 3d creation suite v2.78c. A specially crafted
 .blend file can cause an integer overflow resulting in a buffer overflow
 which can allow for code execution under the context of the application. An
 attacker can convince a user to open the file or use it as a library in
 order to trigger this vulnerability.
