Description:
 Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in JDK and JRE 6 Update 2 and earlier,
 JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 12 and earlier, SDK and JRE 1.4.2_15 and earlier,
 and SDK and JRE 1.3.1_20 and earlier, when an HTTP proxy server is used,
 allows remote attackers to violate the security model for an applet's
 outbound connections via a multi-pin DNS rebinding attack in which the
 applet download relies on DNS resolution on the proxy server, but the
 applet's socket operations rely on DNS resolution on the local machine, a
 different issue than CVE-2007-5274. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2007-5232.
