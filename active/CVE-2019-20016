Description:
 libmysofa before 2019-11-24 does not properly restrict recursive function
 calls, as demonstrated by reports of stack consumption in
 readOHDRHeaderMessageDatatype in dataobject.c and directblockRead in
 fractalhead.c. NOTE: a download of v0.9 after 2019-12-06 should fully
 remediate this issue.
