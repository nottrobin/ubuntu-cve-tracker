Description:
 In Symfony before versions 4.4.7 and 5.0.7, when a `Response` does not
 contain a `Content-Type` header, affected versions of Symfony can fallback
 to the format defined in the `Accept` header of the request, leading to a
 possible mismatch between the response&#39;s content and `Content-Type`
 header. When the response is cached, this can prevent the use of the
 website by other users. This has been patched in versions 4.4.7 and 5.0.7.
