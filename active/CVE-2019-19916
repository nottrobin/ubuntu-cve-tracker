Description:
 In Midori Browser 0.5.11 (on Windows 10), Content Security Policy (CSP) is
 not applied correctly to all parts of multipart content sent with the
 multipart/x-mixed-replace MIME type. This could result in script running
 where CSP should have blocked it, allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS)
 and other attacks when the product renders the content as HTML. Remediating
 this would also need to consider the polyglot case, e.g., a file that is a
 valid GIF image and also valid JavaScript.
