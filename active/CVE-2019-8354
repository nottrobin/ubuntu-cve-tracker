Description:
 An issue was discovered in SoX 14.4.2. lsx_make_lpf in effect_i_dsp.c has
 an integer overflow on the result of multiplication fed into malloc. When
 the buffer is allocated, it is smaller than expected, leading to a
 heap-based buffer overflow.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that SoX incorrectly handled certain MP3 files. An attacker
 could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2019-8354,
 CVE-2019-8355, CVE-2019-8356, CVE-2019-8357)
