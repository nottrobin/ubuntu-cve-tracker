Description:
 An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding
 in the progress display, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker)
 can employ crafted object names to manipulate the client output, e.g., by
 using ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred. This
 affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
  cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
  support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using
 mdeslaur> sftp instead of scp.
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> The updates in USN-3885-1 inverted two CVE numbers by accident.
