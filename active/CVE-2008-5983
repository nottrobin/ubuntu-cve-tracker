Description:
 Untrusted search path vulnerability in the PySys_SetArgv API function in
 Python 2.6 and earlier, and possibly later versions, prepends an empty
 string to sys.path when the argv[0] argument does not contain a path
 separator, which might allow local users to execute arbitrary code via a
 Trojan horse Python file in the current working directory.
