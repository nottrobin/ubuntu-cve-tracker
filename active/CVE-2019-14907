Description:
 All samba versions 4.9.x before 4.9.18, 4.10.x before 4.10.12 and 4.11.x
 before 4.11.5 have an issue where if it is set with "log level = 3" (or
 above) then the string obtained from the client, after a failed character
 conversion, is printed. Such strings can be provided during the NTLMSSP
 authentication exchange. In the Samba AD DC in particular, this may cause a
 long-lived process(such as the RPC server) to terminate. (In the file
 server case, the most likely target, smbd, operates as process-per-client
 and so a crash there is harmless).
