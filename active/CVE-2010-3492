Description:
 The asyncore module in Python before 3.2 does not properly handle
 unsuccessful calls to the accept function, and does not have accompanying
 documentation describing how daemon applications should handle unsuccessful
 calls to the accept function, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
 conduct denial of service attacks that terminate these applications via
 network connections.
