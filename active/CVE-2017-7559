Description:
 In Undertow 2.x before 2.0.0.Alpha2, 1.4.x before 1.4.17.Final, and 1.3.x
 before 1.3.31.Final, it was found that the fix for CVE-2017-2666 was
 incomplete and invalid characters are still allowed in the query string and
 path parameters. This could be exploited, in conjunction with a proxy that
 also permitted the invalid characters but with a different interpretation,
 to inject data into the HTTP response. By manipulating the HTTP response
 the attacker could poison a web-cache, perform an XSS attack, or obtain
 sensitive information from requests other than their own.
