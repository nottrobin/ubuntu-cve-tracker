Description:
 A flaw was found in Ansible 2.7.17 and prior, 2.8.9 and prior, and 2.9.6
 and prior when using the Extract-Zip function from the win_unzip module as
 the extracted file(s) are not checked if they belong to the destination
 folder. An attacker could take advantage of this flaw by crafting an
 archive anywhere in the file system, using a path traversal. This issue is
 fixed in 2.10.
