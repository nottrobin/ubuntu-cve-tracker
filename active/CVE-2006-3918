Candidate: CVE-2006-3918
References:
Description:
 http_protocol.c in (1) IBM HTTP Server 6.0 before 6.0.2.13 and 6.1 before
 6.1.0.1, and (2) Apache HTTP Server 1.3 before 1.3.35, 2.0 before 2.0.58,
 and 2.2 before 2.2.2, does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP
 request when it is reflected back in an error message, which might allow
 cross-site scripting (XSS) style attacks using web client components
 that can send arbitrary headers in requests, as demonstrated using a
 Flash SWF file.
