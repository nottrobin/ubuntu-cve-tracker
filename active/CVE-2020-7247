Description:
 smtp_mailaddr in smtp_session.c in OpenSMTPD 6.6, as used in OpenBSD 6.6
 and other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands
 as root via a crafted SMTP session, as demonstrated by shell metacharacters
 in a MAIL FROM field. This affects the "uncommented" default configuration.
 The issue exists because of an incorrect return value upon failure of input
 validation.
