Description:
 KDE KSSL in kdelibs 3.5.4, 4.2.4, and 4.3 does not properly handle a '\0'
 character in a domain name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an
 X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
 arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate
 Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> kde4libs not as serious since KDE4 has moved to Qt4. However,
  it should be fixed due to other applications may use it. Also, by
  nad checin verification (ie non-netowork) will use kssl.
