Description:
 MaraDNS 1.3.07.12 and 1.4.08 computes hash values for DNS data without
 properly restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably,
 which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU
 consumption) by sending many crafted queries with the Recursion Desired
 (RD) bit set.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for
 CVE-2012-0024.
