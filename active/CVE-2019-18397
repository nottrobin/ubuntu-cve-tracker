Description:
 A stack buffer overflow in the fribidi_get_par_embedding_levels_ex()
 function in lib/fribidi-bidi.c of GNU FriBidi 1.0.0 through 1.0.7 allows an
 attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code by
 delivering crafted text content to a user, when this content is then
 rendered by an application that uses FriBidi for text layout
 calculations. Examples include any GNOME or GTK+ based application that
 uses Pango for text rendering, as this internally uses FriBidi for
 bidirectional text layout. For example, the attacker can construct a
 crafted text file to be opened in GEdit, a crafted IRC message to be viewed
 in HexChat or a crafted email to be viewed in Evolution.
