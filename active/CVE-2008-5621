Description:
 Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in phpMyAdmin 2.11.x before
 2.11.9.4 and 3.x before 3.1.1.0 allows remote attackers to perform
 unauthorized actions as the administrator via a link or IMG tag to
 tbl_structure.php with a modified table parameter.  NOTE: other unspecified
 pages are also reachable, but they have the same root cause.  NOTE: this
 can be leveraged to conduct SQL injection attacks and execute arbitrary
 code.
