Description:
 lib/MT/Upgrade.pm in mt-upgrade.cgi in Movable Type 4.2x and 4.3x through
 4.38 does not require authentication for requests to database-migration
 functions, which allows remote attackers to conduct eval injection and SQL
 injection attacks via crafted parameters, as demonstrated by an eval
 injection attack against the core_drop_meta_for_table function, leading to
 execution of arbitrary Perl code.
