Description:
 In OpenSSH 7.9, scp.c in the scp client allows remote SSH servers to bypass
 intended access restrictions via the filename of . or an empty filename.
 The impact is modifying the permissions of the target directory on the
 client side.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
  cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
  support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.

 mdeslaur> The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using
 mdeslaur> sftp instead of scp.
