Description:
 The demo feature in Oracle GlassFish Open Source Edition 5.0 has TCP port
 7676 open by default with a password of admin for the admin account. This
 allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information,
 perform database operations, or manipulate the demo via a JMX RMI session,
 aka a "jmx_rmi remote monitoring and control problem." NOTE: this is not an
 Oracle supported product.
