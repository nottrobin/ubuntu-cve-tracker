Description:
 ISC DHCP 4.1.x before 4.1-ESV-R13 and 4.2.x and 4.3.x before 4.3.4 does not
 restrict the number of concurrent TCP sessions, which allows remote
 attackers to cause a denial of service (INSIST assertion failure or
 request-processing outage) by establishing many sessions.

Notes:
 mdeslaur> DoS over OMAPI and failover ports only, see ISC kb article
 mdeslaur> for workarounds, or properly limit access to ports
