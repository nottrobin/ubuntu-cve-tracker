Description:
 libuser before 0.56.13-8 and 0.60 before 0.60-7, as used in the userhelper
 program in the usermode package, directly modifies /etc/passwd, which
 allows local users to cause a denial of service (inconsistent file state)
 by causing an error during the modification. NOTE: this issue can be
 combined with CVE-2015-3245 to gain privileges.
