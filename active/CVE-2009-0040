Description:
 The PNG reference library (aka libpng) before 1.0.43, and 1.2.x before
 1.2.35, as used in pngcrush and other applications, allows
 context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application
 crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PNG file that
 triggers a free of an uninitialized pointer in (1) the png_read_png
 function, (2) pCAL chunk handling, or (3) setup of 16-bit gamma tables.
