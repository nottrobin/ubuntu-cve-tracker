Candidate: CVE-2007-0981
References:
Description:
 Mozilla based browsers, including Firefox before 1.5.0.10 and 2.x before
 2.0.0.2, and SeaMonkey before 1.0.8, allow remote attackers to bypass the
 same origin policy, steal cookies, and conduct other attacks by writing a
 URI with a null byte to the hostname (location.hostname) DOM property, due
 to interactions with DNS resolver code.
