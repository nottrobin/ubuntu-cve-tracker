Description:
 The ooh323 channel driver in Asterisk Addons 1.2.x before 1.2.9 and
 Asterisk-Addons 1.4.x before 1.4.7 creates a remotely accessible TCP port
 that is intended solely for localhost communication, and interprets some
 TCP application-data fields as addresses of memory to free, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via crafted
 TCP packets.
