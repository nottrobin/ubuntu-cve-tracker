Description:
 An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x. One of the fixes in XSA-260
 added some safety checks to help prevent Xen livelocking with debug
 exceptions. Unfortunately, due to an oversight, at least one of these
 safety checks can be triggered by a guest. A malicious PV guest can crash
 Xen, leading to a Denial of Service. All Xen systems which have applied the
 XSA-260 fix are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM systems
 are not vulnerable. Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86
 HVM and PVH guests cannot exploit the vulnerability. An attacker needs to
 be able to control hardware debugging facilities to exploit the
 vulnerability, but such permissions are typically available to unprivileged
 users.
