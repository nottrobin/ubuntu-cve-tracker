Description:
 The dissect_oampdu_event_notification function in
 epan/dissectors/packet-slowprotocols.c in the IEEE 802.3 Slow Protocols
 dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.13 and 1.8.x before 1.8.5 does not
 properly handle certain short lengths, which allows remote attackers to
 cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a malformed packet.
