Description:
 When using FORM authentication with Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.29, 8.5.0
 to 8.5.49 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.98 there was a narrow window where an attacker
 could perform a session fixation attack. The window was considered too
 narrow for an exploit to be practical but, erring on the side of caution,
 this issue has been treated as a security vulnerability.
