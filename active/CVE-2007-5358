Description:
 Multiple buffer overflows in the voicemail functionality in Asterisk 1.4.x
 before 1.4.13, when using IMAP storage, might allow (1) remote attackers to
 execute arbitrary code via a long combination of Content-type and
 Content-description headers, or (2) local users to execute arbitrary code
 via a long combination of astspooldir, voicemail context, and voicemail
 mailbox fields.  NOTE: vector 2 requires write access to Asterisk
 configuration files.
