 https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-28465
Description:
 An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source through 13.27.0, 14.x and
 15.x through 15.7.2, and 16.x through 16.4.0, and Certified Asterisk
 through 13.21-cert3. A pointer dereference in chan_sip while handling SDP
 negotiation allows an attacker to crash Asterisk when handling an SDP
 answer to an outgoing T.38 re-invite. To exploit this vulnerability an
 attacker must cause the chan_sip module to send a T.38 re-invite request to
 them. Upon receipt, the attacker must send an SDP answer containing both a
 T.38 UDPTL stream and another media stream containing only a codec (which
 is not permitted according to the chan_sip configuration).
