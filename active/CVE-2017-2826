Description:
 An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the iConfig proxy request
 of Zabbix server 2.4.X. A specially crafted iConfig proxy request can cause
 the Zabbix server to send the configuration information of any Zabbix
 proxy, resulting in information disclosure. An attacker can make requests
 from an active Zabbix proxy to trigger this vulnerability.
