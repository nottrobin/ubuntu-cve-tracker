Description:
 In FFmpeg 4.0.1, an improper argument (AVCodecParameters) passed to the
 avpriv_request_sample function in the handle_eac3 function in
 libavformat/movenc.c may trigger an out-of-array read while converting a
 crafted AVI file to MPEG4, leading to a denial of service and possibly an
 information disclosure.
