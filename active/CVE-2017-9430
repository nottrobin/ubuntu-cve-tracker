Description:
 Stack-based buffer overflow in dnstracer through 1.9 allows attackers to
 cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via a command line with a long name argument that is
 mishandled in a strcpy call for argv[0]. An example threat model is a web
 application that launches dnstracer with an untrusted name string.
