Description:
 An exploitable SQL injection vulnerability exists in the administrator web
 portal function of coTURN prior to version 4.5.0.9. A login message with a
 specially crafted username can cause an SQL injection, resulting in
 authentication bypass, which could give access to the TURN server
 administrator web portal. An attacker can log in via the external interface
 of the TURN server to trigger this vulnerability.
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 ebarretto> As the administration web interface is shared with the production,
 ebarretto> it is unfortunately not possible to easily filter outside access
 ebarretto> and this security update completely disable the web interface.
 ebarretto> Users should use the local, command line interface instead.
