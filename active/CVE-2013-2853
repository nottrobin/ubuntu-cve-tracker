Description:
 The HTTPS implementation in Google Chrome before 28.0.1500.71 does not
 ensure that headers are terminated by \r\n\r\n (carriage return, newline,
 carriage return, newline), which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to have
 an unspecified impact via vectors that trigger header truncation.
