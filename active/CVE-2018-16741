Description:
 An issue was discovered in mgetty before 1.2.1. In fax/faxq-helper.c, the
 function do_activate() does not properly sanitize shell metacharacters to
 prevent command injection. It is possible to use the ||, &&, or >
 characters within a file created by the "faxq-helper activate <jobid>"
 command.
