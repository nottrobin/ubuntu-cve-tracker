Description:
 The Spring MVC in Spring Framework before 3.2.4 and 4.0.0.M1 through
 4.0.0.M2 does not disable external entity resolution for the StAX
 XMLInputFactory, which allows context-dependent attackers to read arbitrary
 files, cause a denial of service, and conduct CSRF attacks via crafted XML
 with JAXB, aka an XML External Entity (XXE) issue, and a different
 vulnerability than CVE-2013-4152.  NOTE: this issue was SPLIT from
 CVE-2013-4152 due to different affected versions.
