Description:
 Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities in vnc.c in the VNC server in QEMU
 0.10.6 and earlier might allow guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on
 the host OS by establishing a connection from a VNC client and then (1)
 disconnecting during data transfer, (2) sending a message using incorrect
 integer data types, or (3) using the Fuzzy Screen Mode protocol, related to
 double free vulnerabilities.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> versions 0.9.1 and earlier are not affected. Need the following
  commit to be affected:
  http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/qemu.git/commit/?id=753b405331. This came in
  0.10.0 (from ChangeLog: 'Multiple VNC clients are now supported')
 jdstrand> kvm-84 as included in Ubuntu 9.04 does not contain the affected
  code (it has a pre-release version of qemu 0.10.0)
 jdstrand> kvm-84 in hardy-backports and intrepid-backports are not affected
  (they are based on kvm-84 from Ubuntu 9.04)
 jdstrand> simply search for VncDisplay in vnc.c to see if might be affected
