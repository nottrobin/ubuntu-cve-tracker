Description:
 SystemTap 1.0, when the --unprivileged option is used, does not properly
 restrict certain data sizes, which allows local users to (1) cause a denial
 of service or gain privileges via a print operation with a large number of
 arguments that trigger a kernel stack overflow, (2) cause a denial of
 service via crafted DWARF expressions that trigger a kernel stack frame
 overflow, or (3) cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via vectors that
 trigger creation of large unwind tables, related to Common Information
 Entry (CIE) and Call Frame Instruction (CFI) records.
