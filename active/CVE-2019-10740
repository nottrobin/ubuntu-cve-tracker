 https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/6638
Description:
 In Roundcube Webmail 1.3.4, an attacker in possession of S/MIME or PGP
 encrypted emails can wrap them as sub-parts within a crafted multipart
 email. The encrypted part(s) can further be hidden using HTML/CSS or ASCII
 newline characters. This modified multipart email can be re-sent by the
 attacker to the intended receiver. If the receiver replies to this (benign
 looking) email, they unknowingly leak the plaintext of the encrypted
 message part(s) back to the attacker.
