Description:
 Tweepy does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in
 the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509
 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers
 via an arbitrary valid certificate, related to use of the Python httplib
 library.
