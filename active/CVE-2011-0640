Description:
 The default configuration of udev on Linux does not warn the user before
 enabling additional Human Interface Device (HID) functionality over USB,
 which allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary programs via
 crafted USB data, as demonstrated by keyboard and mouse data sent by
 malware on a smartphone that the user connected to the computer.
