Description:
 webserver.c in mt-dappd in Firefly Media Server 0.2.4 and earlier allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference and daemon
 crash) via a stats method action to /xml-rpc with (1) an empty
 Authorization header line, which triggers a crash in the ws_decodepassword
 function; or (2) a header line without a ':' character, which triggers a
 crash in the ws_getheaders function.
