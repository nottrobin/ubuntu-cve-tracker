Description:
 The ActionScript 2 virtual machine in Adobe Flash Player 10.x before
 10.0.12.36 and 9.x before 9.0.151.0, and Adobe AIR before 1.5, does not
 validate character elements during retrieval from the dictionary data
 structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL
 pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted PDF file.
