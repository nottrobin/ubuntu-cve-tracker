Description:
 kio/kio/tcpslavebase.cpp in KDE KSSL in kdelibs before 4.6.1 does not
 properly verify that the server hostname matches the domain name of the
 subject of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
 to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a certificate issued by a legitimate
 Certification Authority for an IP address, a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2009-2702.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 jdstrand> kdelibs has a very different ssl implementation and konqueror does
  not use it
