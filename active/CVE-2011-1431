Description:
 The STARTTLS implementation in qmail-smtpd.c in qmail-smtpd in the
 netqmail-1.06-tls patch for netqmail 1.06 does not properly restrict I/O
 buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into
 encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext command that is processed
 after TLS is in place, related to a "plaintext command injection" attack, a
 similar issue to CVE-2011-0411.
