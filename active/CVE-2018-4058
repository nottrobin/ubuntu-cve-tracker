Description:
 An exploitable unsafe default configuration vulnerability exists in the
 TURN server functionality of coTURN prior to 4.5.0.9. By default, the TURN
 server allows relaying external traffic to the loopback interface of its
 own host. This can provide access to other private services running on that
 host, which can lead to further attacks. An attacker can set up a relay
 with a loopback address as the peer on an affected TURN server to trigger
 this vulnerability.
