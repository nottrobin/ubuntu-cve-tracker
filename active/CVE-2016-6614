Description:
 An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin involving the %u username replacement

 substitution is configured, a specially-crafted user name can be used to
 circumvent restrictions to traverse the file system. All 4.6.x versions
 (prior to 4.6.4), 4.4.x versions (prior to 4.4.15.8), and 4.0.x versions
 (prior to 4.0.10.17) are affected.
