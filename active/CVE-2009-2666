Description:
 socket.c in fetchmail before 6.3.11 does not properly handle a '\0'
 character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an
 X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof
 arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate
 Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
