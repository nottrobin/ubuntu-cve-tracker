 https://docs.saltstack.com/en/2016.3/topics/releases/2015.8.13.html
Description:
 When using the local_batch client from salt-api in SaltStack Salt before
 2015.8.13, 2016.3.x before 2016.3.5, and 2016.11.x before 2016.11.2,
 external authentication is not respected, enabling all authentication to be
 bypassed.

 The LocalClient.cmd_batch() method client does not accept external_auth
 credentials and so access to it from salt-api has been removed for
 now. This vulnerability allows code execution for already-authenticated
 users and is only in effect when running salt-api as the root user.
