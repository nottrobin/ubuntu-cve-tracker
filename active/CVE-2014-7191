 https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/qs_dos_memory_exhaustion
Description:
 The qs module before 1.0.0 in Node.js does not call the compact function
 for array data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
 (memory consumption) by using a large index value to create a sparse array.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 ebarretto> This issue is actually for node-querystring.
 ebarretto> Somewhere along the line node-qs was born or forked from
 ebarretto> node-querystring which was deprecated. But now there are again
 ebarretto> new projects called querystring. Be careful when updating.
 ebarretto> Trusty's version is actually based on node-querystring.
