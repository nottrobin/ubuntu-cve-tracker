Description:
 An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before
 2.1.11, and 2.2.x before 2.2.4. If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars()
 and words() methods were passed the html=True argument, they were extremely
 slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking
 vulnerability in a regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are
 used to implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template
 filters, which were thus vulnerable.
