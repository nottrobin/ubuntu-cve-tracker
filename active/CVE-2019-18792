Description:
 An issue was discovered in Suricata 5.0.0. It is possible to bypass/evade
 any tcp based signature by overlapping a TCP segment with a fake FIN
 packet. The fake FIN packet is injected just before the PUSH ACK packet we
 want to bypass. The PUSH ACK packet (containing the data) will be ignored
 by Suricata because it overlaps the FIN packet (the sequence and ack number
 are identical in the two packets). The client will ignore the fake FIN
 packet because the ACK flag is not set. Both linux and windows clients are
 ignoring the injected packet.
