Description:
 Spring Security (Spring Security 4.1.x before 4.1.5, 4.2.x before 4.2.4,
 and 5.0.x before 5.0.1; and Spring Framework 4.3.x before 4.3.14 and 5.0.x
 before 5.0.3) does not consider URL path parameters when processing
 security constraints. By adding a URL path parameter with special
 encodings, an attacker may be able to bypass a security constraint. The
 root cause of this issue is a lack of clarity regarding the handling of
 path parameters in the Servlet Specification. Some Servlet containers
 include path parameters in the value returned for getPathInfo() and some do
 not. Spring Security uses the value returned by getPathInfo() as part of
 the process of mapping requests to security constraints. In this particular
 attack, different character encodings used in path parameters allows
 secured Spring MVC static resource URLs to be bypassed.
