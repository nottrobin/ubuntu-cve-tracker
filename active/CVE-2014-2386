Description:
 Multiple off-by-one errors in Icinga, possibly 1.10.2 and earlier, allow
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified
 vectors to the (1) display_nav_table, (2) print_export_link, (3)
 page_num_selector, or (4) page_limit_selector function in cgi/cgiutils.c or
 (5) status_page_num_selector function in cgi/status.c, which triggers a
 stack-based buffer overflow.
Ubuntu-Description:
Notes:
 sarnold> One-byte overflows of ascii NUL might not normally get a 'medium'
  but there's so many of them fixed that perhaps one might be useful enough
  in an exploit.
