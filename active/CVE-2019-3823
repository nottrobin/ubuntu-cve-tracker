Description:
 libcurl versions from 7.34.0 to before 7.64.0 are vulnerable to a heap
 out-of-bounds read in the code handling the end-of-response for SMTP. If
 the buffer passed to `smtp_endofresp()` isn't NUL terminated and contains
 no character ending the parsed number, and `len` is set to 5, then the
 `strtol()` call reads beyond the allocated buffer. The read contents will
 not be returned to the caller.
