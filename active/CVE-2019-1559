Description:
 If an application encounters a fatal protocol error and then calls
 SSL_shutdown() twice (once to send a close_notify, and once to receive one)
 then OpenSSL can respond differently to the calling application if a 0 byte
 record is received with invalid padding compared to if a 0 byte record is
 received with an invalid MAC. If the application then behaves differently
 based on that in a way that is detectable to the remote peer, then this
 amounts to a padding oracle that could be used to decrypt data. In order
 for this to be exploitable "non-stitched" ciphersuites must be in use.
 Stitched ciphersuites are optimised implementations of certain commonly
 used ciphersuites. Also the application must call SSL_shutdown() twice even
 if a protocol error has occurred (applications should not do this but some
 do anyway). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2r (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2q).
Ubuntu-Description: 
Notes: 
 mdeslaur> doesn't affect 1.1.x
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> this fix is a workaround for applications that call
 mdeslaur> SSL_shutdown() twice even if a protocol error has occurred
 mdeslaur>
 mdeslaur> upstream fix uses error handling mechanism introduced in 1.0.2,
 mdeslaur> which isn't available in 1.0.1f. While we are unlikely to fix
 mdeslaur> this issue in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, marking as deferred for now
 mdeslaur> in case the vulnerable applications are identified.
