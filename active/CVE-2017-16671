Description:
 A Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13 before
 13.18.1, 14 before 14.7.1, and 15 before 15.1.1 and Certified Asterisk
 13.13 before 13.13-cert7. No size checking is done when setting the user
 field for Party B on a CDR. Thus, it is possible for someone to use an
 arbitrarily large string and write past the end of the user field storage
 buffer. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2017-7617, which was only about
 the Party A buffer.
