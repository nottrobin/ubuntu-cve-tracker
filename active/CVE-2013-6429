Description:
 The SourceHttpMessageConverter in Spring MVC in Spring Framework before
 3.2.5 and 4.0.0.M1 through 4.0.0.RC1 does not disable external entity
 resolution, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, cause a
 denial of service, and conduct CSRF attacks via crafted XML, aka an XML
 External Entity (XXE) issue, and a different vulnerability than
 CVE-2013-4152 and CVE-2013-7315.
