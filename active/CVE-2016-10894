Description:
 xtrlock through 2.10 does not block multitouch events. Consequently, an
 attacker at a locked screen can send input to (and thus control) various
 programs such as Chromium via events such as pan scrolling, "pinch and
 zoom" gestures, or even regular mouse clicks (by depressing the touchpad
 once and then clicking with a different finger).
