Description:
 Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.3 are vulnerable to CSRF
 attacks through CORS preflight requests that target Spring MVC
 (spring-webmvc module) or Spring WebFlux (spring-webflux module) endpoints.
 Only non-authenticated endpoints are vulnerable because preflight requests
 should not include credentials and therefore requests should fail
 authentication. However a notable exception to this are Chrome based
 browsers when using client certificates for authentication since Chrome
 sends TLS client certificates in CORS preflight requests in violation of
 spec requirements. No HTTP body can be sent or received as a result of this
 attack.
