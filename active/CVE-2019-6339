Description:
 In Drupal Core versions 7.x prior to 7.62, 8.6.x prior to 8.6.6 and 8.5.x
 prior to 8.5.9; A remote code execution vulnerability exists in PHP's
 built-in phar stream wrapper when performing file operations on an
 untrusted phar:// URI. Some Drupal code (core, contrib, and custom) may be
 performing file operations on insufficiently validated user input, thereby
 being exposed to this vulnerability. This vulnerability is mitigated by the
 fact that such code paths typically require access to an administrative
 permission or an atypical configuration.
