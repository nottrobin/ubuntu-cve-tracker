Description:
 An issue was discovered in Django 2.1 before 2.1.2, in which unprivileged
 users can read the password hashes of arbitrary accounts. The read-only
 password widget used by the Django Admin to display an obfuscated password
 hash was bypassed if a user has only the "view" permission (new in Django
 2.1), resulting in display of the entire password hash to those users. This
 may result in a vulnerability for sites with legacy user accounts using
 insecure hashes.
