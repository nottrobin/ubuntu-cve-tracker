Description:
 The request phase of the OmniAuth Ruby gem is vulnerable to Cross-Site
 Request Forgery when used as part of the Ruby on Rails framework, allowing
 accounts to be connected without user intent, user interaction, or feedback
 to the user. This permits a secondary account to be able to sign into the
 web application as the primary account.
