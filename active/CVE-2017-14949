Description:
 Restlet Framework before 2.3.12 allows remote attackers to access arbitrary
 files via a crafted REST API HTTP request that conducts an XXE attack,
 because only general external entities (not parameter external entities)
 are properly considered. This is related to XmlRepresentation,
 DOMRepresentation, SaxRepresentation, and JacksonRepresentation.
