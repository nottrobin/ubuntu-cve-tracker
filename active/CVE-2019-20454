Description:
 An out-of-bounds read was discovered in PCRE before 10.34 when the pattern
 \X is JIT compiled and used to match specially crafted subjects in non-UTF
 mode. Applications that use PCRE to parse untrusted input may be vulnerable
 to this flaw, which would allow an attacker to crash the application. The
 flaw occurs in do_extuni_no_utf in pcre2_jit_compile.c.
