Description:
 Use-after-free vulnerability in the Document::finishedParsing function in
 core/dom/Document.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before
 29.0.1547.57, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or
 possibly have unspecified other impact via an onload event that changes an
 IFRAME element so that its src attribute is no longer an XML document,
 leading to unintended garbage collection of this document.
