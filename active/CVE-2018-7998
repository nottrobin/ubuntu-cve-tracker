Description:
 In libvips before 8.6.3, a NULL function pointer dereference vulnerability
 was found in the vips_region_generate function in region.c, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified
 other impact via a crafted image file. This occurs because of a race
 condition involving a failed delayed load and other worker threads.
