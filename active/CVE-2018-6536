 https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2/issues/5991
Description:
 An issue was discovered in Icinga 2.x through 2.8.1. The daemon creates an
 icinga2.pid file after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which
 might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to
 this non-root account for icinga2.pid modification before a root script
 executes a "kill `cat /pathname/icinga2.pid`" command, as demonstrated by
 icinga2.init.d.cmake.
