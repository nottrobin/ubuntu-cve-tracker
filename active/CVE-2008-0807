Description:
 lib/Driver/sql.php in Turba 2 (turba2) Contact Manager H3 2.1.x before
 2.1.7 and 2.2.x before 2.2-RC3, as used in products such as Horde Groupware
 before 1.0.4 and Horde Groupware Webmail Edition before 1.0.5, does not
 properly check access rights, which allows remote authenticated users to

 demonstrated by modifying a personal address book entry when there is write
 access to a shared address book.
