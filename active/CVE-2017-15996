Description:
 elfcomm.c in readelf in GNU Binutils 2.29 allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (excessive memory allocation) or possibly have
 unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file that triggers a "buffer
 overflow on fuzzed archive header," related to an uninitialized variable,
 an improper conditional jump, and the get_archive_member_name,
 process_archive_index_and_symbols, and setup_archive functions.
