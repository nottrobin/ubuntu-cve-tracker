Description:
 Directory traversal vulnerability in session.rb in Hiki 0.8.0 through 0.8.6
 allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files via directory traversal
 sequences in the session ID, which is matched against an insufficiently
 restrictive regular expression before it is used to construct a filename
 that is marked for deletion at logout.
