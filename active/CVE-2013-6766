Description:
 A software bug in OpenVAS Administrator allowed an attacker to bypass
 the OAP authentication procedure. The attack vector was remotely
 available in case OpenVAS Administrator was listening on a public
 network interface. In case of successful attack, the attacker was able
 to create and modify users and could use the gained privileges to take
 control over an OpenVAS installation if the Scanner and/or Manager
 instances controlled by this Administrator instance were also listening
 on public network interfaces.
