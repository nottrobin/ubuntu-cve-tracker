Description:
 In WordPress before 4.9.9 and 5.x before 5.0.1, the user-activation page
 could be read by a search engine's web crawler if an unusual configuration
 were chosen. The search engine could then index and display a user's e-mail
 address and (rarely) the password that was generated by default.
