Description:
 Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) before 2.49 uses temporary folder
 locations that allow unprivileged local users to overwrite files. This
 allows a local attack in which either a plugin or the uninstaller can be
 replaced by a Trojan horse program.
Ubuntu-Description:
 It was discovered that NSIS incorrectly handled temporary folders. An attacker
 could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary commands.
