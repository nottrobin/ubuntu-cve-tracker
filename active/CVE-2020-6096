Description:
 An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7 memcpy()
 implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7 targets
 that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative value for the
 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison vulnerability. If an
 attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to memcpy(), this vulnerability
 could lead to undefined behavior such as writing to out-of-bounds memory
 and potentially remote code execution. Furthermore, this memcpy()
 implementation allows for program execution to continue in scenarios where
 a segmentation fault or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in
 that subsequent execution and iterations of this code will be executed with
 this corrupted data.
