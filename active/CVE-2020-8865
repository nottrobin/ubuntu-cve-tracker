Description:
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute local PHP files on
 affected installations of Horde Groupware Webmail Edition 5.2.22.
 Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw
 exists within edit.php. When parsing the params[template] parameter, the
 process does not properly validate a user-supplied path prior to using it
 in file operations. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other
 vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the www-data user. Was
 ZDI-CAN-10469.
