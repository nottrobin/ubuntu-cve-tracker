Description:
 In in wp-includes/rest-api/endpoints/class-wp-rest-posts-controller.php in
 WordPress 3.7 to 5.3.0, authenticated users who do not have the rights to
 publish a post are able to mark posts as sticky or unsticky via the REST
 API. For example, the contributor role does not have such rights, but this
 allowed them to bypass that. This has been patched in WordPress 5.3.1,
 along with all the previous WordPress versions from 3.7 to 5.3 via a minor
 release.
