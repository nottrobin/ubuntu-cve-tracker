Description:
 Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in (1) wp-app.php and (2) app.php in

 upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via unspecified vectors, possibly
 related to the wp_postmeta table and the use of custom fields in normal
 (non-attachment) posts.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an
 incomplete fix for CVE-2007-3543.
