Description:
 The AgentTicketForward feature in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before
 2.4.7 does not properly remove inline images from HTML e-mail messages,
 which allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive image
 information in opportunistic circumstances by reading a forwarded message
 in a standard e-mail client.
