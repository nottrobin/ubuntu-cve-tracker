Description:
 dns_internal.cc in Squid 3.1.6, when IPv6 DNS resolution is not enabled,
 accesses an invalid socket during an IPv4 TCP DNS query, which allows
 remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon
 exit) via vectors that trigger an IPv4 DNS response with the TC bit set.
