Description:
 An issue was discovered in Symfony 2.8.0 through 2.8.50, 3.4.0 through
 3.4.34, 4.2.0 through 4.2.11, and 4.3.0 through 4.3.7. If an application
 passes unvalidated user input as the file for which MIME type validation
 should occur, then arbitrary arguments are passed to the underlying file
 command. This is related to symfony/http-foundation (and symfony/mime in
 4.3.x).
