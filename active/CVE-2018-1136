Description:
 An issue was discovered in Moodle 3.x. An authenticated user is allowed to
 add HTML blocks containing scripts to their Dashboard; this is normally not
 a security issue because a personal dashboard is visible to this user only.
 Through this security vulnerability, users can move such a block to other
 pages where they can be viewed by other users.
