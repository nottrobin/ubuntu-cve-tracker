Description:
 The BN_GF2m_mod_inv function in crypto/bn/bn_gf2m.c in OpenSSL before
 0.9.8s, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0e, 1.0.1 before 1.0.1n, and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2b
 does not properly handle ECParameters structures in which the curve is over
 a malformed binary polynomial field, which allows remote attackers to cause
 a denial of service (infinite loop) via a session that uses an Elliptic
 Curve algorithm, as demonstrated by an attack against a server that
 supports client authentication.
