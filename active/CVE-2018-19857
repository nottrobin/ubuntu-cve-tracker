Description:
 The CAF demuxer in modules/demux/caf.c in VideoLAN VLC media player 3.0.4
 may read memory from an uninitialized pointer when processing magic cookies
 in CAF files, because a ReadKukiChunk() cast converts a return value to an
 unsigned int even if that value is negative. This could result in a denial
 of service and/or a potential infoleak.
