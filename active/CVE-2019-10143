Description:
 ** DISPUTED ** It was discovered freeradius up to and including version
 3.0.19 does not correctly configure logrotate, allowing a local attacker
 who already has control of the radiusd user to escalate his privileges to
 root, by tricking logrotate into writing a radiusd-writable file to a
 directory normally inaccessible by the radiusd user. NOTE: the upstream
 software maintainer has stated "there is simply no way for anyone to gain
 privileges through this alleged issue."
